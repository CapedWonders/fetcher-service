      "title": "Cambridge Analytica shuts down amid scandal over use of Facebook data",
      "body": "Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign and had come under attack for its use of personal Facebook data in other elections, announced on Wednesday it would cease operations and declare bankruptcy in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nThe firm said it had lost clients because of revelations in March that it had improperly obtained the personal information of millions of Facebook users. \"It is no longer viable to continue operating the business,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement.\n\nCambridge Analytica defended its use of Facebook, saying it was \"vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\"\n\nThe decision by the firm comes as it continues to face potential investigations and sanctions from regulators around the world for charges.\n\nThe controversial tactics of Cambridge Analytica - whose former vice president, Republican strategist Steve Bannon, later worked for Trump's campaign and in the White House - first came to light in March in news reports that it had amassed data from tens of millions of Americans through a Facebook quiz app. Facebook suspended the firm at the time.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Facebook said, \"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\"\n\nBannon, who later left the company, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCritics of Cambridge Analytica and the largely unregulated use of personal data for political campaigns said the closing of the company will have little effect on the kinds of abuses that the company is alleged to have committed.\n\n\"The closing of Cambridge Analytica doesn't stop the problem that voters and consumers face in terms of a growing loss of privacy and a gross misuse of their data,\" said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy. \" Cambridge Analytica's practices, although it crossed ethical boundaries, is really emblematic of how data driven digital marketing occurs worldwide. Americans are currently helpless to stop the massive flows of their personal information now regularly fed to Google, Facebook, ISPs and many others.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica was born of as an American offshoot of London-based SCL Group, whose affiliates had worked in campaigns around the world, including Kenya, Nigeria and India. Initial funding for Cambridge Analytica came from Republican financier Robert Mercer, who invested at least $10 million in the company as it sought to help exclusively GOP candidates across a range of U.S. congressional and state legislative elections beginning in 2014. His daughter Rebekah Mercer was the company's first president. Neither Mercer responded to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nIn 2014, Cambridge Analytica gained access to the Facebook data of tens of millions of people using a technique widely used during that era to collect information on Facebook users. Among its leading clients then was a super PAC controlled by Republican John Bolton, now Trump's national security adviser.\n\nDesigned by an outside researcher named Alexander Kogan, the tool, called ThisIsYourDigitalLife, collected information not only on Facebook users who approved it but also their friends. In total, Facebook has said that Cambridge Analytica had access to data on 87 million people, including 71 million Americans, in its efforts to create detailed profiles about voters' backgrounds and behaviors, as well as what types of political messages might appeal to them based on their personalities.\n\nCambridge Analytica used this and other data - collected from data brokers and other sources - to fuel its Project Ripon, an effort to win Republican races that was named for the birthplace of the party, Ripon, Wisconsin. Former Cambridge Analytica employees have said that this work was done almost entirely in London, by people employed by the British-based SCL Group, and that some of these foreigners went to work directly on U.S. campaigns. This practice raised questions about whether the company complied with federal election law that limits the roles played by non-U. S. citizens in American campaigns.

      "body": "London, May 3 (PTI): Cambridge Analytica, the UK-based political consulting firm embroiled in a massive data-harvesting scandal that compromised the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users, has announced that it would immediately cease operations as the controversy had driven away virtually all of its customers.\n\nThe decision was made less than two months after Cambridge Analytica and Facebook became embroiled in the scandal. Revelations about the misuse of data, plunged Facebook into crisis and prompted regulators to open investigations.\n\nCambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing, but says that the negative media coverage has left it with no clients and mounting legal fees which has forced it to resort to closure.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration,\" it added.\n\nThe firm's board has applied to appoint insolvency practitioners Crowe Clark Whitehill to act as the independent administrator for Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAdditionally, parallel bankruptcy proceedings will soon be commenced on behalf of Cambridge Analytica and certain of the Company's US affiliates in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nNoting that over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations, the company said despite its efforts to correct the record, it has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\n\nYesterday company's employees were asked to return their keycards immediately.\n\n\"SCL Elections, as well as certain of its and Cambridge Analytica LLC's UK affiliates filed applications to commence insolvency proceedings in the U.K.,\" the company said.\n\nThis could impact its Indian operations as well.\n\nDuring a conference by Julian Wheatland, SCL Group's chairman and the man who was supposed to become the next full-time CEO of Cambridge Analytica after former CEO Alexander Nix stepped down, said that the board determined that rebranding the company's offerings in the current environment is futile.\n\nThe report of an independent investigation released by Cambridge Analytica said that it was involved in several elections in India since 2010, but refuted allegations that it was involved in interference.\n\nThe firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients.\n\nAccording to Facebook, data on up to 87 million of its users was harvested by an app and then passed on to the political consultancy.\n\nThe social network said its own probe into the matter would continue.\n\n\"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" a Cambridge Analytica (CA) spokesperson said.\n\nThe company said its parent company, SCL Elections, would also commence bankruptcy proceedings. This could impact its Indian operations as well.\n\nThe chair of a UK Parliament committee investigating the firm's activities also raised concerns about CA and SCL Elections' move to shut down.\n\n\"They are party to very serious investigations and those investigations cannot be impeded by the closure of these companies,\" said MP Damian Collins.\n\n\"I think it's absolutely vital that the closure of these companies is not used as an excuse to try and limit or restrict the ability of the authorities to investigate what they were doing,\" he said.\n\nCambridge Analytica has been linked to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump's campaign denies having used CA's data.\n\nIt sought information on Facebook to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the US electorate.\n\nThe company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that appeared to be a personality test.\n\nThe app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nFacebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions.",

      "title": "Did this London firm use stolen data to make Brits vote for Brexit?",
      "body": "BRITISH company Cambridge Analytica became engulfed in a Facebook data scandal which put the social media giant in the spotlight on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHere's what we know about data firm Cambridge Analytica, the Facebook data breach and the company's board of directors.\n\nCambridge Analytica is a London-based company that helps business and political groups \"change audience behaviour\".\n\nThey muster up data on voters through their internet-use. This data is then analysed and packaged so that political spin doctors can create more effective slogans and campaign messages.\n\nThe company was only set up in 2013, launching as a spin-off project from parent company SCL Group.\n\nIt collects data from sources including social media platforms like Facebook.\n\nOn May 2, 2018, the firm announced it was to close down and end all operations amid concerns over legal fees and the loss of clients following the data scandal.\n\nIn a statement Cambridge Analytica said: \"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by Mr Malins' report [independent investigator Julian Malins], the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica inappropriately gained access to data from 50 million Facebook users in the US.\n\nThis data was used to help get their client Donald Trump elected.\n\nThe alleged breach came to light thanks to a Cambridge Analytica whistleblower called Christopher Wylie.\n\nHe said: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles\".\n\nFacebook said the 87 million users whose data might have been shared with the political firm would get a message on their feeds.\n\nIt said most of the affected users are in the US, though there are over a million each in the Philippines, Indonesia and the UK.\n\nThere are around 40million Facebook users in Britain, so that means you have a roughly 1 in 40 chance of having had your data hoovered up without your knowledge.\n\nFacebook's Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer revealed shared the number while discussing the steps the company was taking to restrict the personal data available to third-party app developers.\n\n\"And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.\n\n\"That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"\n\nThe data analysis firm's London offices have since been searched by police amid widespread concern over its work.\n\nMozilla was among the first major organisations to stop advertising on Facebook in response to concerns over the protection it offered to users' data.\n\nThe company said it is \"pressing pause\" on Facebook advertising at least until the social network strengthens its safeguarding.\n\nA Cambridge psychology professor called Aleksandr Kogan built an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" in 2015.\n\nIt was a personality quiz that asked Facebook users to provide information about themselves.\n\nThrough his company Global Science Research, Kogan shared the info obtained from the app with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nOnly 270,000 Facebook users actually signed up and took personality tests.\n\nBut the app also harvested data of all the Facebook friends connected to those users, without the permission of those friends.\n\nFacebook reportedly knew about the data harvesting in 2015, and asked companies holding the data to delete it - but had no way of making sure that they actually did so.\n\nThis dodgy data harvesting may be illegal in a number of countries, and violates Facebook's own data policy.\n\nEuropean Parliament president Antonio Tajani said: \"Allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens' privacy rights.\n\n\"The European Parliament will investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account.\"\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused requests from British MPs to explain its response to the scandal.\n\nHe instead said he \"personally asked\" one of his deputies to attend.\n\nIn the US, the government opened a privacy investigation into the social media giant.\n\nRelated: How to download all your Facebook data\n\nOn April 9, Zuckerberg apologised for \"not doing enough\" to protect Facebook users data being misused.\n\nIt came in written testimony to US lawmakers, in which he admitted Facebook was slow to spot Russian election hacking, but he did not reveal new information.\n\nIn the prepared remarks, Zuckerberg, 33, said Facebook has a responsibility to make sure what happened with Cambridge Analytica doesn't happen again.\n\nHe said: \"We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that10 was a big mistake.\n\n\"It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica is part of SCL Group, with whom it shares some of its directors.\n\nAlexander Nix, 42, is CEO of both Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections, but was suspended after comments he made about entrapping clients' rivals with Ukrainian prostitutes were broadcast by Channel 4.\n\nMark Turnbull is managing director of Cambridge Analytica's political division.\n\nMr Turnbull spent 18 years at communications firm Bell Pottinger before he joined SCL.\n\nThe co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign Arron Banks said that Cambridge Analytica helped with pro-Brexit campaigns during the run-up to the 2016 referendum.\n\nBut Cambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix denies this.\n\nInstead, Nix says the companies only had exploratory meetings.\n\n\"We didn't get hitched. We dated each other. We had a couple of dinners but we didn't get married,\" he told MPs at the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee for an investigation into fake news.\n\nBut in his book on the EU referendum, Banks said that Cambridge Analytica was \"hired\" in 2015 to \"develop messages\" for voters.\n\nHowever, Nix maintains that Cambridge Analytica \"did not work for Leave.EU\", and added: \"We have not undertaken any paid nor unpaid work for them.\"\n\n\"I can only assume that they felt by associating themselves and aligning themselves with Cambridge Analytica, that would give the extra credibility and leverage in trying to compete in a bid where they were clearly the underdogs.\"",

But the larger lesson of the scandal that brought down one of President Donald Trump's campaign vendors is that politics and data are now inextricably linked -- with or without Cambridge Analytica in the picture.\n\nCambridge Analytica, as it made clear in its farewell news release on Wednesday, was part of a much broader development in politics -- a world increasingly fueled by vast troves of personal data that billions of Internet users emit every day. The company said it was being unfairly singled out for doing things that are \"widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\"\n\nIn a world with few laws governing how data is used, some of the ashes of Cambridge Analytica already are being resurrected in a new firm, with some of the same key people, in a British company, Emerdata.\n\nEven without Cambridge Analytica or Emerdata, politicians now have the tools to target us each individually -- based on data suggesting our race, religion, income, shopping habits, sexual orientation, medical concerns, personality traits, current location, past locations, pet preference or Zodiac sign if they'd like. The implosion of Cambridge Analytica has made clear how politics often works in our increasingly digital world.\n\nThe trove of documents shared publicly by the company's former research director, Christopher Wylie, illustrates that granular personal data on each of us can be used to create precise messages to any individual voter, then delivered to us through the online ecosystem over Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter and other free services. Such tactics have long been standard in commerce -- ever noticed how ads for those nice hiking boots keep following you around the Web? -- but all these tactics of manipulation are equally available to those working in largely unregulated political realms too.\n\nPoliticians hired Cambridge Analytica to use this technology to shape events in many countries across the world. That includes places, like Kenya and Nigeria, where democracy is new and fragile, and places like Britain and the United States, where there is less of an expectation of voter manipulation.\n\nThough there has long been skepticism about whether Cambridge Analytica was as effective as it claimed, experts expect this technology to only improve, especially as artificial intelligence and virtual reality steadily grow more powerful. The era of campaign season \"deep fakes\" -- imagine a convincing but phony clip of a politician doing something appalling -- is not far off.\n\nEven as Cambridge Analytica announced bankruptcy, regulators around the world pledged they would continue investigating the company. In the United Kingdom, the country's top data protection authority, the Information Commissioner's Office, said in a statement it would \"pursue individuals and directors, as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating.\"\n\nYet longtime watchers of these issues take little comfort in Cambridge Analytica's decision to declare bankruptcy. Jonathan Albright, a social media analyst who has been studying the company for nearly two years, saw it as little more than a legal maneuver.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica's business entity -- an unincorporated LLC -- is the natural target of lawsuits. Dissolving the company greatly reduces the legal and financial liabilities associated with its data mishandling practices in the future,\" said Albright, research director a Columbia's Tow Center for Digital Journalism.\n\nYet it's not even clear that the people who created Cambridge Analytica are leaving this field. As freelance journalist Wendy Siegelman and Business Insider reported last month, two members of the Mercer family -- major backers of conservative political causes whose money and management was key to Cambridge Analytica from the beginning -- have joined the board of Emerdata.\n\nAccording to British public filings, Emerdata was incorporated in August 2017 and Rebekah Mercer and her sister were appointed to its board on March 20 of this year, days after news broke of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The filings show that suspended Cambridge Analytica CEO, Alexander Nix, briefly served on the board of Emerdata, alongside Johnson Ko, a partner of Trump ally Erik Prince.\n\nFilings also show that Julian Wheatland, chairman of Cambridge Analytica parent company, SCL Group, and Cambridge Analytica's data officer, Alexander Tayler, were both people with \"significant control\" of Emerdata at the time of its creation. The company's incorporation documents say Emerdata is a company that specializes in \"data processing, hosting and related activities.,\" very similar to the work of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCambridge Analytica, meanwhile, appeared to leave the door open to selling its data and other key assets to some other company. The privacy policy for Cambridge Analytica, last updated in April 2017, said that \"personal data held about its registered supporters will be one of the transferred assets.\"\n\nBut focusing on the known actors in this drama potentially obscures the larger issues at play. We know that a Cambridge University researcher collected granular Facebook data on 87 million people in 2014 and shared it with Cambridge Analytica, according to Facebook. Yet we also know that the tactics the researcher used were commonplace in these years, and some in the industry estimate that thousands of app developers did essentially the same thing -- and we have no idea what happened to all of that data.\n\n(Cambridge Analytica and others involved in the collection of Facebook data says it has destroyed it all, but there's no way to verify if it's all gone or lingering somewhere unknown.)\n\nStill more broadly, the Internet as it has evolved over the past couple of decades is essentially a data gathering machine, in which we all trade information about ourselves -- our likes and dislikes, what we look at on the Web, our countless online utterances -- in exchange for free services we need, or merely enjoy.\n\nNow Cambridge Analytica has shown that this all powers more than mere advertising for cellphones or dog food. This data-gathering machinery can be used to shape who we vote for, or whether we vote at all, or how we make choices on big referendums, such as whether Britain leaves the European Union.\n\nEven though some close watchers of the digital economy have been warning about this danger for years, the stakes look bigger now that Cambridge Analytica has revealed the full nature of the trade off we all have been making: We give up data for free stuff. Tech companies make billions of dollars by selling advertising based on what they learn about us. Those advertisers then try to get us to do things -- buy stuff, vote for people, vote against other people.\n\n\"The idea of targeting, or trying to get a particular behavior, that's not new -- that's advertising,\" said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"I think fundamentally what the Cambridge Analytica incident revealed was that there was a lot of data being collected, [and] consumers largely are not always aware of what was collected on them or how it was being used.\"\n\nThis is an ecosystem in which we long have been willing participants. Yet the recent public uproar and Congressional hearings show that our role in this ecosystem has both surprised and alarmed many people.\n\nCambridge Analytica is vanishing from view, but the increasingly common political art it practiced is not.",

      "body": "NEW YORK -- Cambridge Analytica, the Trump-affiliated data firm at the centre of Facebook's worst privacy scandal in history, is declaring bankruptcy and shutting down.\n\nThe London firm blamed \"unfairly negative media coverage\" and said it has been \"vilified\" for actions it says are both legal and widely accepted as part of online advertising.\n\nCambridge Analytica said it has filed papers to begin insolvency proceedings in the U.K. and will seek bankruptcy protection in a federal court in New York.\n\n\"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.\"\n\nFacebook said it will keep looking into data misuse by Cambridge Analytica even though the firm is closing down. And Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a digital advocacy group in Washington, said criticisms of Facebook's privacy practices won't go away just because Cambridge Analytica has.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica's practices, although it crossed ethical boundaries, is really emblematic of how data-driven digital marketing occurs worldwide,\" Chester said. \"Rather than rejoicing that a bad actor has met its just reward, we should recognize that many more Cambridge Analytica-like companies are operating in the conjoined commercial and political marketplace.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica, whose clients included Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, sought information on Facebook users to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate.\n\nThe company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that purported to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nCanadian firm AggregateIQ Data Services Ltd., which has been linked to Cambridge Analytica but consistently denied any connection, said Wednesday it is business as usual and has no plans of shuttering.\n\n\"AggregateIQ is and has always been 100 per cent Canadian owned and operated. AggregateIQ has never been a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL. We have no plans to close our business,\" co-founder Jeff Silverster told The Canadian Press.\n\nBut whistleblower Christopher Wylie, claims he helped found AggregateIQ while he worked for SCL, which is the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. Wylie also alleges that Cambridge Analytica used data harvested from more than 50-million Facebook users to help U.S. President Donald Trump win the 2016 election.\n\nFacebook suspended AggregateIQ from its platform last month following reports that the company may be connected to Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL.\n\nThe Victoria-based company is under investigation by privacy officials in Ottawa, B.C. and the United Kingdom for its role in influencing the outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit referendum. It is also under investigation for allegedly violating limits on spending during that campaign to benefit the \"leave\" side.\n\nFacebook estimates the personal information of 622,161 users in Canada -- and nearly 87 million worldwide -- was improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress for the first time in two days of hearings. Facebook also has suspended other companies for using similar tactics. One is Cubeyou, which makes personality quizzes. That company has said it did nothing wrong and is seeking reinstatement.\n\nCambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix in March pending an investigation after Nix boasted of various unsavoury services to an undercover reporter for Britain's Channel 4 News. Channel 4 News broadcast clips that showed Nix saying his data-mining firm played a major role in securing Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nActing CEO Alexander Tayler also stepped down in April and returned to his previous post as chief data officer.\n\nCambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data. On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica said an outside investigation it commissioned concluded the allegations were not \"borne out by the facts.\"\n\nFacebook's audit of the firm has been suspended while U.K. regulators conduct their own probe. But Facebook says Cambridge Analytica's decision to close \"doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation. But the office of U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in March that the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.\n\nDenham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.",

      "body": "Cambridge Analytica's chief executive officer Alexander Nix gives an interview during the 2017 Web Summit in Lisbon on November 9, 2017.\n\nCambridge Analytica, the political ad marketing firm that worked for President Trump and was involved in the misappropriation of 87 million Facebook users' data, is closing its offices.\n\nThe specialist in political predictions announced that bankruptcy proceedings will begin in the U.S., as well as insolvency proceedings in the U.K, where the firm has an office and where its parent company The SCL Group is based.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe company came to public attention in March when Facebook announced -- on the eve of two explosive newspaper reports in The New York Times and the U.K.'s Observer -- it had learned Cambridge Analytica and its parent company had failed to delete personal data that the social network knew it had improperly obtained on Facebook users three years ago.\n\nCambridge, according to Facebook, had obtained the data from Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at the University of Cambridge. A personality research app he created gathered the personal information on 270,000 Facebook users, as well as data on those users' friends, amplifying the reach to the tens of millions when it passed that data to Cambridge for a voter targeting scheme.\n\nFacebook said it thought Cambridge had deleted the data, but the Times' and Observer reports cited former employees and documents that the data was used to target voters during the 2016 presidential election. The disclosures forced Facebook into crisis mode as regulators and lawmakers clamored for an explanation and users started a #DeleteFacebook campaign.\n\nThe giant social network eventually admitted it had been too loose with controls over its customers' data and ushered in a series of changes that gave Facebook's 2.2 billion members oversight over their personal information. It has continued to blame Cambridge Analytics and researcher Kogan for their actions, which they have denied.\n\n\"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" Facebook said in a statement sent to USA TODAY. \"We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\"\n\nFacebook said it planned an audit of Cambridge Analytica but was awaiting one from U.K. regulators.\n\nCambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix had been suspended in March after a series of TV broadcasts showed him making controversial statements about his firm's work on elections, including how Cambridge Analytica played a major role in Trump's presidential victory.\n\nThe fortunes of Cambridge Analytica were closely tied to the Trump campaign's successful win for the White House, and some of the fallout from the Facebook data scandal has overlapped with federal investigations into that 2016 race. The firm claimed it could predict how people will vote based on the 5,000 pieces of data it collected on nearly every American adult combined with the results of thousands of personality surveys. It had touted its role as swinging the presidential election.\n\nTwo of President Trump's biggest boosters, American hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer and former White House aide Steve Bannon, had invested in Cambridge Analytica. Bannon, who divested his stake in April, was also a vice president at the company from 2014 to 2016 and received a monthly consulting fee until 2016.\n\nWhile at the firm, Bannon began preparing for the 2016 election two years in advance, according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who testified before House Democrats in a closed-door session last month. Bannon directed the firm to test messages such as \"build the wall\" and \"drain the swamp\" and to test images and concepts for a U.S. audience relating to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian expansion in Eastern Europe, he testified.\n\nBannon was not concerned whether campaign ads created and promoted through Cambridge Analytica had false information because he was trying to win a \"culture war,\" Wylie testified. \"Cambridge Analytica was set up to be essentially a full-service propaganda machine,\" he said.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller has asked the firm to turn over its internal documents as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe concerns about potential misuse of data and digital marketing to undermine privacy extend beyond Cambridge Analytica to firms across the political spectrum, says Jeff Chester, executive director for privacy watchdog group Center for Digital Democracy.\n\n\"Rather than rejoicing that a bad actor has met its just reward, we should recognize that many more Cambridge Analytica-like companies are operating in the conjoined commercial and political marketplace,\" Chester said in a statement. \"Without a federal privacy law to protect consumer privacy online, and an empowered and emboldened FEC, Americans will continue to be victimized by the out-of-control 'Big Data' surveillance apparatus that is the core of our digital -- and political -- experience.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica's bankruptcy is just the latest development in the continued fallout from the scandal, which extended this week to Facebook's headquarters. Jan Koum, founder and CEO of WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook acquired four years ago for $16 billion, said Monday he was leaving Facebook and the company's board of directors. Koum's strong stance on privacy is seen as motivation for his departure.\n\nAlso this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who in April was peppered with questions about privacy during two Congressional hearings, announced new, upcoming Facebook features to address users' concerns. Among them: the ability to delete data Facebook gathers on you as you visit websites and apps.\n\nCambridge Analytica maintained \"unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully,\" the company said Wednesday, but \"the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers.\"\n\nThat led to the decision to file for bankruptcy, the company says. \"Despite the Company's precarious financial condition, Cambridge Analytica intends to fully meet its obligations to its employees, including with respect to notice periods, severance terms, and redundancy entitlements,\" it said.\n\nCambridge Analytica, with offices in New York, Washington and London, has said it has 107 full-time employees. Most of the employees work in its central London headquarters.\n\nThe company decided to shut down because it was losing clients and had growing legal fees from the Facebook investigation, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. .\n\nMore: Cambridge Analytica active in elections, big data projects for years",

      "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- The Latest on Cambridge Analytica, firm behind Facebook privacy debacle (all times local):\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nOne digital-rights advocate says criticisms of Facebook's privacy practices won't go away just because Cambridge Analytica has decided to close.\n\nJeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy says Cambridge Analytica's practices are \"emblematic of how data driven digital marketing occurs worldwide.\" He says there are \"many more Cambridge Analytica-like companies are operating in the conjoined commercial and political marketplace.\"\n\nFacebook says it's still committing to investigating Cambridge Analytica \"to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica said Wednesday that it's declaring bankruptcy and shutting down. The firm says the media furor stripped it of its customers and suppliers, forcing it to close.\n\n-- -- --\n\n4:10 p.m.\n\nNorth Carolina's Democratic Party has filed a formal complaint over work performed by Cambridge Analytica for the campaign of Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nCambridge Analytica has been accused of vacuuming data from Facebook users to try to influence the 2016 presidential race. It announced Wednesday that it's closing down because of what it considers vilification in the media.\n\nNorth Carolina Democrats filed an Federal Election Commission complaint against Tillis' campaign and the state Republican Party. Democrats allege they violated the law because Cambridge Analytica employees were foreign nationals who helped make key campaign decisions.\n\nCambridge's website describes using the company's \"unique data-rich voter file\" to build high-tech profiles for all North Carolina voters that were used to increase turnout and help Tillis unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3:25 p.m.\n\nFacebook says it will keep looking into data misuse by Cambridge Analytica even though the firm is closing down.\n\nCambridge Analytica said Wednesday it will cease all operations immediately. The company has been linked to Donald Trump's election campaign and sparked a scandal when it was revealed it collected Facebook user data inappropriately. In a statement Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica insists it has done nothing wrong and has been \"vilified\" in the media.\n\nFacebook's audit of the firm has been suspended while U.K. regulators conduct their own probe. But Facebook says Cambridge Analytica's decision to close \"doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\n3 p.m.\n\nThe data firm at the center of Facebook's privacy scandal is declaring bankruptcy and shutting down.\n\nIn a statement, Cambridge Analytica says it has been \"vilified\" for actions it says are both legal and widely accepted as part of online advertising. The firm says the media furor stripped it of its customers and suppliers, forcing it to close.\n\nCambridge Analytica sought information on Facebook to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate. The company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that appeared to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\n-- -- --\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nA published report says the data firm at the center of Facebook's privacy debacle is closing its doors.\n\nCambridge Analytica has been linked to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The British firm suspended its CEO Alexander Tayler in April amid investigations.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says Wednesday's shutdown comes as the firm is losing clients and facing legal fees from the Facebook case.\n\nCambridge Analytica did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCambridge Analytica sought information on Facebook to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate.

      "body": "Cambridge Analytica, the company which has been in the news recently for meddling with the Facebook user data of close to 87 million users, and which is being investigated by regulators in the US and UK, has shut shop. For a data firm that has important clients, a lot of them with political interests, this was a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe offices of Cambridge Analytica in central London. AP\n\nAfter suspending its then CEO Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica continued to lose clients and its legal bills continued to rise, thanks to the Facebook investigations. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, SCL Group and SCL Elections, two organisations affiliated with Cambridge Analytica are also shutting down their offices in the US and the UK.\n\nBlaming the media for the current situation, a joint statement by Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections said, \"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations. The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers. As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.\" Parallel bankruptcy proceedings would also begin shortly, the company said.\n\nAccording to Cambridge Analytica, it was treated unfairly for practices which are a standard component of online advertising in the commercial and political spheres.\n\nAccording to WSJ, company employees saw this coming and current SCL chairman Julian Wheatland said that the company would effectively be shut down by Wednesday. He also said that an \"independent investigation\" of the company was completed, finding it not guilty. For an outsider, an independent investigation commissioned by Cambridge Analytica itself can sound like nothing but a sham.\n\nNew bottle, old wine\n\nJust because Cambridge Analytica has announced that it is shutting down, it does not in any way mean the kind of work it did will also shut down. Far from it.\n\nBy its own admission, as discovered by Channel 4 in an undercover investigation, Nix and a representative from Cambridge Analytica had bragged about how it has been operating in many markets under various pseudonyms and in a way that it couldn't be traced back to Cambridge Analytica. What's to stop it from operating under a new name in a non-US or UK market?\n\nThis New York Times report even hints at the fact that Cambridge Analytica executives and SCL Group along with the Mercer family have created a new company called Emerdata, which is UK-based. Could Emerdata be a rebranded Cambridge Analytica? Why can't it? It's like the fabled Hydra or an unkillable torrent site. Chop one head and another two will rise to take its place. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, the business remains, it's only the name that's changing.\n\nLest we forget, Cambridge Analytica could still have access to the vast trove of data it has on 87 million users, all of which was acquired from Facebook. According to NYT, people who are familiar with the matter said that there were even plans to sell off the combined data of Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group along with intellectual properties. If true, this is something that will not go down well with regulators.\n\nCEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, speaks during the Web Summit, Europe's biggest tech conference, in Lisbon, Portugal, November 9, 2017. Image: Reuters\n\nWhether you like it or not, Cambridge Analytica had proved its mettle (helping with the Trump campaign in the 2016 US Presidential elections), albeit with questionable means. But if its talents can help politicians win elections, then there will always be a lot of interested parties. With election narratives increasingly being exploited online, data manipulation and data harvesting will still continue, irrespective of Cambridge Analytica. It was natural that no political party would have liked to be associated with Cambridge Analytica after the Facebook data scandal came to light. But if it's another company doing similar work, and which hasn't been pounded by the media both offline and online, it's fair game for any ambitious political party. There's big money in this venture as well.\n\nHere's a paper explaining how Big Data analytics has, in the recent past and most likely in the future too, played a big role in winning political campaigns.\n\nOf course, Facebook, we hope, will not be part of this equation in the way it was with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, but there are other ways come up with psychographic profiles. This report explains how Peter Thiel' data-mining company, Palantir, has multiple tools at its disposal to track American citizens.\n\nInvestigations to continue\n\nIf Cambridge Analytica thought that shutting down the company would solve matters, then that won't be the case. According to the BBC, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has clearly said that civil and criminal investigations against Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group will continue. They are also not permitted to delete their data history by shutting down.\n\n\"We've got to make sure this isn't an attempt to run and hide, that these companies are not closing down to try to avoid them being rigorously investigated over the allegations that are being made against them,\" said Damian Collins chair of the Commons select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).\n\nTo sum it up, Cambridge Analytica shutting down is just a symbolic measure. The work it was doing though, will still continue in some form or the other.\n\nUpdated Date: May 03, 2018 17:13 PM",

Thom Tillis.\n\nCambridge Analytica has been accused of vacuuming data from Facebook users to try to influence the 2016 presidential race. It announced Wednesday that it's closing down because of what it considers vilification in the media.\n\nNorth Carolina Democrats filed an Federal Election Commission complaint against Tillis' campaign and the state Republican Party. Democrats allege they violated the law because Cambridge Analytica employees were foreign nationals who helped make key campaign decisions.\n\nCambridge's website describes using the company's \"unique data-rich voter file\" to build high-tech profiles for all North Carolina voters that were used to increase turnout and help Tillis unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan.\n\n3:25 p.m.\n\nFacebook says it will keep looking into data misuse by Cambridge Analytica even though the firm is closing down.\n\nCambridge Analytica said Wednesday it will cease all operations immediately.

      "body": "Cambridge Analytica, the embattled UK-based data analytics and political consulting firm that worked on Donald Trump's American Presidential election campaign, has shut down citing a loss of business amid a raging scandal that it compromised the personal information of 87 million Facebook users, including that of over 5,00,000 Indians, .\n\nIn a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it would immediately cease operations and bankruptcy proceedings would soon begin. Reacting to the news, senior IT Ministry officials in New Delhi said the Indian Government will continue with its enquiry into the Cambridge Analytica data leak issue.\n\nThe decision was made less than two months after Cambridge Analytica and Facebook became embroiled in the scandal.\n\nRevelations about the misuse of data, plunged Facebook into crisis and prompted regulators to open investigations.\n\nCambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing, but says that the negative media coverage has left it with no clients and mounting legal fees which has forced it to resort to closure.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration,\" it added.\n\nUS-based social media giant Facebook has said that nearly 5.62 lakh people in India were \"potentially affected\" by its global data breach involving Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook has informed the government that \"only 335 people\" in India were directly affected through the installation of an app and another 562,120 people were \"potentially affected\" as friends of those users. Facebook has over 20 crore users in India.\n\nCambridge Analytica's board has also applied to appoint insolvency practitioners Crowe Clark Whitehill to act as the independent administrator. Additionally, parallel bankruptcy proceedings will soon be commenced on behalf of Cambridge Analytica and certain of the Company's US affiliates in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe report of an independent investigation released by Cambridge Analytica said that it was involved in several elections in India since 2010, but refuted allegations that it interfered in the poll process. The firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients.\n\nAccording to Facebook, data on up to 87 million of its users was harvested by an app and then passed on to the political consultancy. Facebook has said its own probe would continue.\n\nMeanwhile, British authorities today said that their investigation into the data breach scandal involving Cambridge Analytica will not be impacted with the shutdown of the political consulting firm. A spokesperson for Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said investigators will \"examine closely\" the details of the closure and will \"closely monitor any successor companies\".\n\n\"The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to pursue individuals and directors as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating,\" she said.\n\nThe chair of a UK Parliament committee investigating the firm's activities also raised concerns about CA and SCL Elections' move to shut down. \"They are party to very serious investigations and those investigations cannot be impeded by the closure of these companies,\" said MP Damian Collins.\n\n\"I think it's absolutely vital that the closure of these companies is not used as an excuse to try and limit or restrict the ability of the authorities to investigate what they were doing,\" he said.\n\nCambridge Analytica has been linked to US President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump's campaign denies having used CA's data. It sought information on Facebook to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the US electorate, media reports said.\n\nThe company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that appeared to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves. Facebook has since apologised and tightened its privacy restrictions.",

      "body": "Washington - Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign and had come under attack for its use of personal Facebook data in other elections, announced on Wednesday it would cease operations and declare bankruptcy in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nThe firm said it had lost clients because of revelations in March that it had improperly obtained the personal information of millions of Facebook users. \"It is no longer viable to continue operating the business,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement.\n\nCambridge Analytica defended its use of Facebook, saying it was \"vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\"\n\nThe decision by the firm comes as it continues to face potential investigations and sanctions from regulators around the world for charges.\n\nThe controversial tactics of Cambridge Analytica -- whose former vice president, Republican strategist Steve Bannon, later worked for Trump's campaign and in the White House -- first came to light in March in news reports that it had amassed data from tens of millions of Americans through a Facebook quiz app. Facebook suspended the firm at the time.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Facebook said, \"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\"\n\nDesigned by an outside researcher named Alexander Kogan, the tool, called ThisIsYourDigitalLife, collected information not only on Facebook users who approved it but also their friends. In total, Facebook has said that Cambridge Analytica had access to data on 87 million people, including 71 million Americans, in its efforts to create detailed profiles about voters' backgrounds and behaviors, as well as what types of political messages might appeal to them based on their personalities.\n\nIn 2015, Facebook demanded that Cambridge Analytica delete all the data it had collected. But a former employee turned whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, alleged this year that the data analysis firm continued to rely on Facebook information despite assuring otherwise.\n\nThe controversy has triggered a groundswell of criticism, investigations into both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook around the world, multiple hearings in the US Congress and the potential for fines and other penalties.\n\nAdding to its headaches, Cambridge Analytica's since-suspended executive, Alexander Nix, was caught on tape by a UK news broadcaster suggesting that the firm could use bribes and sex workers to entrap politicians it had hoped to defeat. Cambridge Analytica has denied the charges.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the firm said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nEven as it maintained its innocence, Cambridge Analytica acknowledged that the \"siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers.\" SCL Elections, its parent, as well as Cambridge Analytica began insolvency proceedings in the UK, and said they would soon start bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.\n\nThe Washington Post",

Reuters\n\nFacebook said it will keep looking into data misuse by Cambridge Analytica even though the firm is closing down. And Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a digital advocacy group in Washington, said criticisms of Facebook's privacy practices won't go away just because Cambridge Analytica has.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica's practices, although it crossed ethical boundaries, is really emblematic of how data-driven digital marketing occurs worldwide,\" Chester said. \"Rather than rejoicing that a bad actor has met its just reward, we should recognize that many more Cambridge Analytica-like companies are operating in the conjoined commercial and political marketplace.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica, whose clients included Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, sought information on Facebook users to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate.\n\nThe company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that purported to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nFacebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress for the first time in two days of hearings. Facebook also has suspended other companies for using similar tactics. One is Cubeyou, which makes personality quizzes. That company has said it did nothing wrong and is seeking reinstatement.\n\nCambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix in March pending an investigation after Nix boasted of various unsavory services to an undercover reporter for Britain's Channel 4 News. Channel 4 News broadcast clips that showed Nix saying his data-mining firm played a major role in securing Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nActing CEO Alexander Tayler also stepped down in April and returned to his previous post as chief data officer.\n\nCambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data. On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica said an outside investigation it commissioned concluded the allegations were not \"borne out by the facts.\"\n\nFacebook's audit of the firm has been suspended while U.K. regulators conduct their own probe. But Facebook says Cambridge Analytica's decision to close \"doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation. But the office of U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in March that the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.\n\nDenham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.\n\nUpdated Date: May 03, 2018 03:36 AM",

      "body": "Credit: AP/KIRSTY O'CONNOR\n\nCambridge Analytica's headquarters is in central London. The political consulting firm says the revelations about its misuse of Facebook data has cost it nearly all of its customers.\n\nThe political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica announced Wednesday that it will cease most operations and file for bankruptcy over growing legal and political scrutiny of its business practices and work for President Donald Trump.\n\nThe decision was made less than two months after the firm and Facebook became embroiled in a data-harvesting scandal involving compromised personal information of up to 87 million people.\n\nRevelations about the misuse of data, first published in March by The New York Times and The Observer of London, plunged social media giant Facebook into controversy and prompted regulators and lawmakers to open investigations into Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIn a statement posted to its website, Cambridge Analytica said the scandal had driven away virtually all of the company's customers, forcing it to file for bankruptcy in the United States and Britain. The elections division of Cambridge Analytica's British affiliate, SCL Group, will likewise shut down, the company said.\n\nBut the company's announcement left several questions unanswered, including who would retain the company's intellectual property -- the so-called psychometric voter profiles built in part with Facebook data -- and whether Cambridge Analytica's election business would return under new auspices.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company's statement said.\n\nCambridge Analytica also said the results of an independent investigation it had commissioned, which it released Wednesday, contradicted assertions made by former employees and contractors about its acquisition of Facebook data.\n\nNews of the bankruptcy was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo. Cambridge Analytica did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe company, bankrolled by Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who invested at least $15 million, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Those modeling techniques underpinned Cambridge Analytica's work for the Trump campaign and for other candidates in 2014 and 2016.\n\nBut Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny over the past year, first for its purported methods of profiling voters and then over allegations that it improperly harvested private data from Facebook users. Last year, the company was drawn into the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe company also was forced to suspend its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a British television channel released an undercover video. In it, Nix suggested that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.\n\nCambridge Analytica was able to amass its database of information on Facebook users quickly with the help of an app that purported to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nFacebook has since announced changes to its policies for collecting and handling user data. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testified last month before Congress, where he faced criticism for failing to protect users' data.\n\nFacebook also has suspended other companies for using similar tactics. One is Cubeyou, which makes personality quizzes. That company has said it did nothing wrong and is seeking reinstatement.\n\nFacebook's audit of Cambridge Analytica has been suspended while U.K. regulators conduct their own probe. But Facebook says the firm's decision to close \"doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation. But the office of U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in March that the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.\n\nDenham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against the misuse of data.\n\nA DIFFERENT FIRM\n\nIn recent months, executives at Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group, along with the Mercer family, have moved to create a new firm, Emerdata, based in Britain, according to British records.\n\nThe new company's directors include Johnson Ko Chun Shun, a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince. Prince founded the private security firm Blackwater, which was renamed Xe Services after Blackwater contractors were convicted of killing Iraqi civilians.\n\nCambridge and SCL officials privately raised the possibility that Emerdata could be used for a Blackwater-style rebranding of Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group, according to two people with knowledge of the companies who asked for anonymity to describe confidential conversations. One plan under consideration was to sell off the combined company's data and intellectual property.\n\nAn executive and a part owner of SCL Group, Nigel Oakes, has publicly described Emerdata as a way of rolling up the two companies under one new banner. Efforts to reach him by phone Wednesday were unsuccessful.\n\nA former Cambridge Analytica employee said staff members were originally told that there would be an all-hands meeting Tuesday but that it was pushed back a day. Then, after assembling at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, they were kept waiting through the morning and much of the afternoon before Julian Wheatland, the company's chief executive, delivered the news.\n\nThe damage to the company's reputation was simply too severe, and it was \"futile\" and \"pointless\" to try to rebuild during the investigations in the United States and Britain, Wheatland said, according to the former Cambridge Analytica employee. The former employee, who was informed by those in attendance, asked not to be identified because the person did not wish to be publicly associated with the firm.\n\nEmployees in Washington were told the news in a conference call later in the day. They were then told to turn over their identification cards and any company property they had, and go home. By 2 p.m., Cambridge Analytica offices on Pennsylvania Avenue were empty except for a single man, who refused to answer questions from a reporter.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg of The New York Times; and by Mae Anderson of The Associated Press.",

the offices of PKF Littlejohn based in Canary Wharf.\n\nOn Wednesday, executive and part owner of SCL Group - which formed Cambridge Analytica - described Emerdata as a way of combing the two companies under a single banner, reported New York Times.\n\nThe firm's directors are Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer.\n\nThey are daughters of hedge fund billionaire and prominent Donald Trump supporter Robert Mercer, who is also reported to be a major investor in Cambridge Analytica.\n\nRebekah Mercer's New York contact address is the same as Cambridge Analytica.\n\nChief data officer of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Taylor, was removed from the company's filings as a shareholder in January and is now a director at Emerdata.\n\nThe ex-chief of Cambridge Analytica Alexander Nix (pictured) and Julian Wheatland have been listed as directors of Esmerdata\n\n'It's like the hydra beast of Greek mythology -- you cut one head off and another one grows,' Damian Collins, chair of the UK parliamentary select committee for digital, culture, media and sport said, writes the FT.\n\n'I think it will be business as usual for Cambridge Analytica but under a different name', he said.\n\nLast week a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson did not deny the companies were linked.\n\n'Many international corporates have different divisions and different arms for different types of the business,' he said.\n\nWhen asked if Cambridge Analytica would reformulate, the spokesperson said: 'That is a business decision, the [Cambridge Analytica] company board in due course will assess the findings of the independent investigation and will take any relevant decisions then.'\n\nHOW TO CHECK IF YOUR DATA WAS SHARED WITH CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA\n\nAll 2.2 billion Facebook users began to receive a notification automatically at the top their newsfeed after it was launched on Tuesday, April 10, a day later than expected.\n\nTitled 'Protecting Your Information,' it contains a link to let you see what apps you use and what information you have shared with them.\n\nAffected users are automatically presented with a notice that says: 'We have banned the website \"This Is Your Digital Life,\" which one of your friends used Facebook to log into.\n\n'We did this because the website may have misused some of your Facebook information by sharing it with a company called Cambridge Analytica.'\n\nUsers can then click on a 'See how you're affected' button to find out more as well as to remove permission for apps and websites you've logged into via Facebook to have access to your profile.\n\nFor those not affected by the Cambridge Analytica incident the message reads: 'You can go to the Apps and Websites section of your settings anytime to see the apps and websites you've used Facebook to log into.'\n\nThe 'Go to apps and websites' button will provide quick access to review and amend these permissions.\n\nA separate 'How can I tell if my info was shared with Cambridge Analytica?' tool will also resolve the question for you.\n\nTo manually access this tool, click the link here.\n\nUsers not believed to be affected will see the message 'Based on our available records, neither you nor your friends logged into \"This Is Your Digital Life.\"\n\n'As a result, it doesn't appear your Facebook information was shared with Cambridge Analytica by \"This Is Your Digital Life\".'\n\nAffected users will see a different message and they will be asked to to change their app settings, available here.\n\nThis is something that is still advisable for the security conscious, removing permissions for apps you no longer need or don't recognise.\n\nFacebook is not notifying individual users of the identify of friends who may have used the 'This Is Your Digital Life' app.",

      "body": "New York: Cambridge Analytica, the Trump-affiliated data firm at the center of Facebook's worst privacy scandal in history, is declaring bankruptcy and shutting down.\n\nThe London firm blamed \"unfairly negative media coverage'' and said it has been \"vilified'' for actions it says are both legal and widely accepted as part of online advertising.\n\nCambridge Analytica said it has filed papers to begin insolvency proceedings in the UK and will seek bankruptcy protection in a federal court in New York.\n\n\"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,'' Cambridge Analytica said in a statement.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.''\n\nFacebook said it will keep looking into data misuse by Cambridge Analytica even though the firm is closing down. And Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a digital advocacy group in Washington, said criticisms of Facebook's privacy practices won't go away just because Cambridge Analytica has.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica's practices, although it crossed ethical boundaries, is really emblematic of how data-driven digital marketing occurs worldwide,'' Chester said.\n\n\"Rather than rejoicing that a bad actor has met its just reward, we should recognize that many more Cambridge Analytica-like companies are operating in the conjoined commercial and political marketplace.''\n\nCambridge Analytica, whose clients included Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, sought information on Facebook users to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the US electorate.\n\nThe company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that purported to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nFacebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress for the first time in two days of hearings.\n\nFacebook also has suspended other companies for using similar tactics. One is Cubeyou, which makes personality quizzes. That company has said it did nothing wrong and is seeking reinstatement.\n\nCambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix in March pending an investigation after Nix boasted of various unsavoury services to an undercover reporter for Britain's Channel 4 News. Channel 4 News broadcast clips that showed Nix saying his data-mining firm played a major role in securing Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nActing CEO Alexander Tayler also stepped down in April and returned to his previous post as chief data officer.\n\nCambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica said an outside investigation it commissioned concluded the allegations were not \"borne out by the facts.''\n\nFacebook's audit of the firm has been suspended while UK regulators conduct their own probe. But Facebook says Cambridge Analytica's decision to close \"doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.''\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it is committed to helping the UK investigation. But the office of UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in March that the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.\n\nDenham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.",

Revelations about the misuse of data, plunged Facebook into crisis and prompted regulators to open investigations.\n\nCambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing, but says that the negative media coverage has left it with no clients and mounting legal fees which has forced it to resort to closure.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration,\" it added.\n\nUS-based social media giant Facebook has said that nearly 5.62 lakh people in India were \"potentially affected\" by its global data breach involving Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook has informed the government that \"only 335 people\" in India were directly affected through the installation of an app and another 562,120 people were \"potentially affected\" as friends of those users. Facebook has over 20 crore users in India.\n\nCambridge Analytica's board has also applied to appoint insolvency practitioners Crowe Clark Whitehill to act as the independent administrator.\n\nAdditionally, parallel bankruptcy proceedings will soon be commenced on behalf of Cambridge Analytica and certain of the Company's US affiliates in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe report of an independent investigation released by Cambridge Analytica said that it was involved in several elections in India since 2010, but refuted allegations that it interfered in the poll process.\n\nThe firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients.\n\nAccording to Facebook, data on up to 87 million of its users was harvested by an app and then passed on to the political consultancy.\n\nMeanwhile, British authorities today said that their investigation into the data breach scandal involving Cambridge Analytica will not be impacted with the shutdown of the political consulting firm.\n\nA spokesperson for Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said investigators will \"examine closely\" the details of the closure and will \"closely monitor any successor companies\".\n\n\"The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to pursue individuals and directors as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating,\" she said.\n\nThe chair of a UK Parliament committee investigating the firm's activities also raised concerns about CA and SCL Elections' move to shut down.\n\n\"They are party to very serious investigations and those investigations cannot be impeded by the closure of these companies,\" said MP Damian Collins.\n\n\"I think it's absolutely vital that the closure of these companies is not used as an excuse to try and limit or restrict the ability of the authorities to investigate what they were doing,\" he said.\n\nCambridge Analytica has been linked to US President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

      "body": "The political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica announced Wednesday that it will cease most operations and file for bankruptcy over growing legal and political scrutiny of its business practices and work for President Donald Trump.\n\nThe decision was made less than two months after the firm and Facebook became embroiled in a data-harvesting scandal involving compromised personal information of up to 87 million people.\n\nRevelations about the misuse of data, first published in March by The New York Times and The Observer of London, plunged social media giant Facebook into controversy and prompted regulators and lawmakers to open investigations into Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIn a statement posted to its website, Cambridge Analytica said the scandal had driven away virtually all of the company's customers, forcing it to file for bankruptcy in the United States and Britain. The elections division of Cambridge Analytica's British affiliate, SCL Group, will likewise shut down, the company said.\n\nBut the company's announcement left several questions unanswered, including who would retain the company's intellectual property -- the so-called psychometric voter profiles built in part with Facebook data -- and whether Cambridge Analytica's election business would return under new auspices.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company's statement said.\n\nCambridge Analytica also said the results of an independent investigation it had commissioned, which it released Wednesday, contradicted assertions made by former employees and contractors about its acquisition of Facebook data.\n\nNews of the bankruptcy was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo. Cambridge Analytica did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe company, bankrolled by Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who invested at least $15 million, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Those modeling techniques underpinned Cambridge Analytica's work for the Trump campaign and for other candidates in 2014 and 2016.\n\nBut Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny over the past year, first for its purported methods of profiling voters and then over allegations that it improperly harvested private data from Facebook users. Last year, the company was drawn into the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe company also was forced to suspend its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a British television channel released an undercover video. In it, Nix suggested that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.\n\nCambridge Analytica was able to amass its database of information on Facebook users quickly with the help of an app that purported to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nFacebook has since announced changes to its policies for collecting and handling user data. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testified last month before Congress, where he faced criticism for failing to protect users' data.\n\nFacebook also has suspended other companies for using similar tactics. One is Cubeyou, which makes personality quizzes. That company has said it did nothing wrong and is seeking reinstatement.\n\nFacebook's audit of Cambridge Analytica has been suspended while U.K. regulators conduct their own probe. But Facebook says the firm's decision to close \"doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation. But the office of U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in March that the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.\n\nDenham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against the misuse of data.\n\nA DIFFERENT FIRM\n\nIn recent months, executives at Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group, along with the Mercer family, have moved to create a new firm, Emerdata, based in Britain, according to British records.\n\nThe new company's directors include Johnson Ko Chun Shun, a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince. Prince founded the private security firm Blackwater, which was renamed Xe Services after Blackwater contractors were convicted of killing Iraqi civilians.\n\nCambridge and SCL officials privately raised the possibility that Emerdata could be used for a Blackwater-style rebranding of Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group, according to two people with knowledge of the companies who asked for anonymity to describe confidential conversations. One plan under consideration was to sell off the combined company's data and intellectual property.\n\nAn executive and a part owner of SCL Group, Nigel Oakes, has publicly described Emerdata as a way of rolling up the two companies under one new banner. Efforts to reach him by phone Wednesday were unsuccessful.\n\nA former Cambridge Analytica employee said staff members were originally told that there would be an all-hands meeting Tuesday but that it was pushed back a day. Then, after assembling at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, they were kept waiting through the morning and much of the afternoon before Julian Wheatland, the company's chief executive, delivered the news.\n\nThe damage to the company's reputation was simply too severe, and it was \"futile\" and \"pointless\" to try to rebuild during the investigations in the United States and Britain, Wheatland said, according to the former Cambridge Analytica employee. The former employee, who was informed by those in attendance, asked not to be identified because the person did not wish to be publicly associated with the firm.\n\nEmployees in Washington were told the news in a conference call later in the day. They were then told to turn over their identification cards and any company property they had, and go home. By 2 p.m., Cambridge Analytica offices on Pennsylvania Avenue were empty except for a single man, who refused to answer questions from a reporter.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg of The New York Times; and by Mae Anderson of The Associated Press.",

      "body": "Cambridge Analytica, the firm embroiled in a controversy over its handling of Facebook Inc user data and its British parent, SCL Elections Ltd, are shutting down immediately after suffering a sharp drop in business, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nThe company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014.\n\nThe offices of Cambridge Analytica in central London. AP\n\n\"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers,\" the statement said.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\"\n\nAllegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump's 2016 US election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world's biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company's statement said.\n\nThe firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices on Wednesday. At SCL's Washington, DC office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter.\n\nAfter the announcement, Britain's data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue \"individuals and directors as appropriate\" despite the shutdown.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\" a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said in a statement.\n\nCambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on US elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.\n\nCambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.\n\nAfter Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the New York Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \"secret sauce\" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.\n\nOne unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia's Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive.\n\nBannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.\n\nUpdated Date: May 03, 2018 07:31 AM",

      "body": "MANILA, Philippines -- Responding to reports after publication of a photograph that linked suspended Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix and close allies of President Duterte, presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. yesterday said the Chief Executive won \"fair and square\" in 2016.\n\n\"We should respect the President's landslide victory, which was a result of the trust and confidence of the Filipino people, and not undermine it with unsubstantiated allegations,\" Roque said.\n\n\"Support for the former Davao city mayor was from all sectors and not just from Facebook or online; thus, the Duterte campaign did not have to purchase information,\" Roque added.\n\nLast Sunday, Presidential Communications Operations Office undersecretary Joel Sy Egco, Jose Gabriel La Viña and Peter La Viña were seen in a photo with Nix at a forum of the National Press Club in May 2015, a year before the presidential elections.\n\nFor his part, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, erstwhile campaign manager of President Duterte, has denied transacting with Cambridge Analytica for Duterte's presidential bid.\n\nRoque added that Dominguez had no knowledge about Cambridge Analytica's role in Duterte's campaign.\n\n\"The Secretary of Finance, in his capacity as treasurer of the campaign, assures us that he did not pay Cambridge Analytica or transacted with them,\" Roque said in a statement.\n\nFor this part, opposition Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV is seeking a Senate inquiry into the questionable participation of Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nHe said there was reason to believe that there was \"undue influence\" exerted during the 2016 presidential elections by the British consulting firm that resulted in President Duterte winning the polls.\n\nHe said based on reports, Duterte's officials have been linked to Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"It's only Duterte who did fake news during the campaign, and his people are linked to Cambridge Analytica, so you can see that if you got into power through cheating and deception, you will continue to use your power to cheat and deceive,\" Trillanes told reporters.\n\nThe National Privacy Commission (NPC) earlier met with officials of social media giant Facebook over reports of a massive data breach involving Cambridge Analytica.\n\nNPC commissioner Raymund Liboro said they met with Facebook representatives to discuss the data breach, which involved over 87 million users worldwide.\n\n\"Facebook told the NPC that 558 Filipino users installed Aleksandr Kogan's personality quiz app, through which personal data may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica,\" Liboro said.\n\n\"From this, 1,175,312 more Filipinos may have been subsequently affected via sharing, making the Philippines the second most affected country in terms of total number of data subjects,\" he added.\n\nEarlier data released by the social media company showed the Philippines ranked second in terms of the number of users affected by the data breach, next to the US, which had data of 70 million users compromised. - Paolo Romero",

      "title": "What Cambridge Analytica reveals about us",
      "body": "The larger lesson of the scandal that brought down one of President Trump's campaign vendors is that politics and data are now inextricably linked. We give up privacy for free access, and the cost is often unclear.\n\nThe demise of Cambridge Analytica on Wednesday may bring a fleeting sense of relief to those worried about personal data being used to shape how they vote, or even the outcome of entire elections.\n\nBut the larger lesson of the scandal that brought down one of President Trump's campaign vendors is that politics and data are now inextricably linked -- with or without Cambridge Analytica in the picture.\n\nCambridge Analytica, as it made clear in its farewell statement, was part of a much broader development in politics -- a world increasingly fueled by vast troves of personal data that billions of Internet users emit every day. The company said it was being unfairly singled out for for doing things that are \"widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\"\n\nIn a world with few laws governing how data is used, some of the ashes of Cambridge Analytica are already being resurrected in another British firm, Emerdata, with some of the same key people.\n\nEven without Cambridge Analytica or Emerdata, politicians now have the tools to target us each individually -- based on data suggesting our race, religion, income, shopping habits, sexual orientation, medical concerns, personality traits, current location, past locations, pet preference or Zodiac sign if they'd like. The implosion of Cambridge Analytica has made clear how politics often works in our increasingly digital world.\n\nThe documents shared publicly by the company's former research director, Christopher Wylie, illustrates that granular personal data on each of us can be used to create precise messages to any individual voter, then delivered to us through the online ecosystem over Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter and other free services. Such tactics have long been standard in commerce -- ever noticed how ads for those nice hiking boots keep following you around the Web? -- but all these tactics of manipulation are equally available to those working in largely unregulated political realms too.\n\nPoliticians hired Cambridge Analyica to use this technology to shape events in many countries across the world. That includes places, such as Kenya and Nigeria, where democracy is new and fragile, and places such as Britain and the United States, where there is less of an expectation of voter manipulation.\n\nThough there has long been skepticism about whether Cambridge Analytica was as effective as it claimed, experts expect this technology to improve, especially as artificial intelligence and virtual reality steadily grow more powerful. The era of campaign season \"deep fakes\" -- imagine a convincing but phony clip of a politician doing something appalling -- is not far off.\n\nEven as Cambridge Analytica announced bankruptcy, regulators around the world pledged they would continue investigating the company. In the United Kingdom, the country's top data-protection authority, the Information Commissioner's Office, said in a statement it would \"pursue individuals and directors, as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating.\"\n\nYet longtime watchers of these issues take little comfort in Cambridge Analytica's decision to declare bankruptcy. Jonathan Albright, a social-media analyst who has been studying the company for nearly two years, saw it as little more than a legal maneuver.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica's business entity -- an unincorporated LLC -- is the natural target of lawsuits. Dissolving the company greatly reduces the legal and financial liabilities associated with its data-mishandling practices in the future,\" said Albright, research director at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism.\n\nYet it's not even clear that the people who created Cambridge Analytica are leaving this field. As freelance journalist Wendy Siegelman and Business Insider reported last month, two members of the Mercer family -- major backers of conservative political causes whose money and management was key to Cambridge Analytica from the beginning -- have joined the board of Emerdata.\n\nBritish public filings show that Emerdata was incorporated in August 2017 and Rebekah Mercer and her sister were appointed to its board on March 20 of this year, days after news broke of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The filings show that suspended Cambridge Analytica CEO, Alexander Nix, briefly served on the board of Emerdata, alongside Johnson Ko, a partner of Trump ally Erik Prince.\n\nFilings also show that Julian Wheatland, chairman of Cambridge Analytica parent company SCL Group, and Cambridge Analytica's data officer, Alexander Tayler, were both people with \"significant control\" of Emerdata at the time of its creation. The company's incorporation documents say Emerdata is a company that specializes in \"data processing, hosting and related activities,\" very similar to the work of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCambridge Analytica, meanwhile, appeared to leave the door open to selling its data and other key assets to some other company. The privacy policy for Cambridge Analytica, last updated in April 2017, said that \"personal data held about its registered supporters will be one of the transferred assets.\"\n\nBut focusing on the known actors in this drama potentially obscures the larger issues at play. We know that a Cambridge University researcher collected granular Facebook data on 87 million people in 2014 and shared it with Cambridge Analytica, according to Facebook. Yet we also know that the tactics the researcher used were commonplace in these years, and some in the industry estimate that thousands of app developers did essentially the same thing -- and we have no idea what happened to all of that data.\n\n(Cambridge Analytica and others involved in the collection of Facebook data says it has destroyed it all, but there's no way to verify if it's all gone.)\n\nStill more broadly, the internet as it has evolved over the past couple of decades is essentially a data-gathering machine, in which we all trade information about ourselves -- our likes and dislikes, what we look at on the web, our countless online utterances -- in exchange for free services we need, or merely enjoy.\n\nNow Cambridge Analytica has shown that this all powers more than mere advertising for cellphones or dog food. This data-gathering machinery can be used to shape who we vote for, or whether we vote at all, or how we make choices on big referendums, such as whether Britain leaves the European Union.\n\nEven though some close watchers of the digital economy have been warning about this danger for years, the stakes look bigger now that Cambridge Analytica has revealed the full nature of the tradeoff we all have been making: We give up data for free stuff. Tech companies make billions of dollars by selling advertising based on what they learn about us. Those advertisers then try to get us to do things -- buy stuff, vote for people, vote against other people.\n\n\"The idea of targeting, or trying to get a particular behavior, that's not new -- that's advertising,\" said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"I think fundamentally what the Cambridge Analytica incident revealed was that there was a lot of data being collected, [and] consumers ... [were] not always aware of what was collected on them or how it was being used.\"\n\nThis is an ecosystem in which we long have been willing participants. Yet the recent public uproar and congressional hearings show that our role in this ecosystem has both surprised and alarmed many people.\n\nCambridge Analytica is vanishing from view, but the increasingly common political art it practiced is not.",

      "body": "Cambridge Analytica, the firm embroiled in a controversy over its handling of Facebook Inc user data, and its British parent SCL Elections Ltd, are shutting down immediately after suffering a sharp drop in business, the company said.\n\nThe company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014.\n\n\"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers,\" the statement said. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\" Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world's biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company's statement said. The firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices on Wednesday. At SCL's Washington, D.C. office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter. After the announcement, Britain's data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue \"individuals and directors as appropriate\" despite the shutdown.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\" a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.\n\nCambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \"secret sauce\" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.\n\nOne unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia's Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive.\n\nBannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.",

Thom Tillis.\n\nCambridge Analytica has been accused of vacuuming data from Facebook users to try to influence the 2016 presidential race. It announced Wednesday that it's closing down because of what it considers vilification in the media.\n\nNorth Carolina Democrats filed an Federal Election Commission complaint against Tillis' campaign and the state Republican Party. Democrats allege they violated the law because Cambridge Analytica employees were foreign nationals who helped make key campaign decisions.\n\nCambridge's website describes using the company's \"unique data-rich voter file\" to build high-tech profiles for all North Carolina voters that were used to increase turnout and help Tillis unseat Democratic Sen.

      "body": "NEW YORK -- Cambridge Analytica, the Trump-affiliated data firm at the center of Facebook's worst privacy scandal in history, is declaring bankruptcy and shutting down.\n\nThe London firm blamed \"unfairly negative media coverage\" and said it has been \"vilified\" for actions it says are both legal and widely accepted as part of online advertising.\n\nCambridge Analytica said it has filed papers to begin insolvency proceedings in the U.K. and will seek bankruptcy protection in a federal court in New York.\n\n\"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.\"\n\nFacebook said it will keep looking into data misuse by Cambridge Analytica even though the firm is closing down. And Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a digital advocacy group in Washington, said criticisms of Facebook's privacy practices won't go away just because Cambridge Analytica has.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica's practices, although it crossed ethical boundaries, is really emblematic of how data-driven digital marketing occurs worldwide,\" Chester said. \"Rather than rejoicing that a bad actor has met its just reward, we should recognize that many more Cambridge Analytica-like companies are operating in the conjoined commercial and political marketplace.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica, whose clients included Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, sought information on Facebook users to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate.\n\nThe company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that purported to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nFacebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress for the first time in two days of hearings. Facebook also has suspended other companies for using similar tactics. One is Cubeyou, which makes personality quizzes. That company has said it did nothing wrong and is seeking reinstatement.\n\nCambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix in March pending an investigation after Nix boasted of various unsavory services to an undercover reporter for Britain's Channel 4 News. Channel 4 News broadcast clips that showed Nix saying his data-mining firm played a major role in securing Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nActing CEO Alexander Tayler also stepped down in April and returned to his previous post as chief data officer.\n\nCambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data. On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica said an outside investigation it commissioned concluded the allegations were not \"borne out by the facts.\"\n\nFacebook's audit of the firm has been suspended while U.K. regulators conduct their own probe. But Facebook says Cambridge Analytica's decision to close \"doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation. But the office of U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in March that the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.\n\nDenham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.",

      "body": "Cambridge Analytica, the firm embroiled in a controversy over its handling of Facebook Inc user data, and its British parent SCL Elections Ltd, are shutting down immediately after suffering a sharp drop in business, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nThe company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014.\n\n\"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers,\" the statement said.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\"\n\nAllegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump's 2016 US election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world's biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company's statement said.\n\nThe firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices on Wednesday. At SCL's Washington, DC office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter.\n\nAfter the announcement, Britain's data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue \"individuals and directors as appropriate\" despite the shutdown.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\" a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said in a statement.\n\nCambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on US elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.\n\nCambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.\n\nAfter Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \"secret sauce\" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.\n\nOne unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia's Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive.\n\nBannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.",

(Photo by Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nCambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign and had come under attack for its use of personal Facebook data in other elections, announced on Wednesday it would cease operations and declare bankruptcy in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nThe firm said it had lost clients because of revelations in March that it had improperly obtained the personal information of millions of Facebook users. \"It is no longer viable to continue operating the business,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement.\n\nCambridge Analytica defended its use of Facebook, saying it was \"vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\"\n\nThe decision by the firm comes as it continues to face potential investigations and sanctions from regulators around the world for charges.\n\nThe controversial tactics of Cambridge Analytica -- whose former vice president, Republican strategist Stephen K. Bannon, later worked for Trump's campaign and in the White House -- first came to light in March in news reports that it had amassed data from tens of millions of Americans through a Facebook quiz app. Facebook suspended the firm at the time.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Facebook said, \"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\"\n\nDesigned by an outside researcher named Alexander Kogan, the tool, called ThisIsYourDigitalLife, collected information not only on Facebook users who approved it but also their friends. In total, Facebook has said that Cambridge Analytica had access to data on 87 million people, including 71 million Americans, in its efforts to create detailed profiles about voters' backgrounds and behaviors, as well as what types of political messages might appeal to them based on their personalities.\n\nIn 2015, Facebook demanded that Cambridge Analytica delete all the data it had collected. But a former employee turned whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, alleged this year that the data analysis firm continued to rely on Facebook information despite assuring otherwise.\n\nThe controversy has triggered a groundswell of criticism, investigations into both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook around the world, multiple hearings in the U.S. Congress and the potential for fines and other penalties.\n\nAdding to its headaches, Cambridge Analytica's since-suspended chief executive, Alexander Nix, was caught on tape by a UK news broadcaster suggesting that the firm could use bribes and sex workers to entrap politicians it had hoped to defeat. Cambridge Analytica has denied the charges.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the firm said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nEven as it maintained its innocence, Cambridge Analytica acknowledged that the \"siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers.\" SCL Elections, its parent, as well as Cambridge Analytica began insolvency proceedings in the UK, and said they would soon start bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.",

However, the damage appeared to be much greater in the other direction, as the controversial Cambridge Analytica announced Wednesday that it would cease operations and file for bankruptcy.\n\nCambridge Analytica is shutting down.

Insolvency proceedings will soon commence in the U.K., while equivalent procedures for bankruptcy will go into effect for its U.S. office. In short, Cambridge Analytica blamed the Facebook scandal for its closure.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\"\n\nThrough it all, Cambridge Analytica's statement insisted that it did nothing wrong. The negative press appeared to scare away potential business partners, making the company financially insolvent thanks to a \"siege of media coverage.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica announced it will go out of business following the Facebook data mining scandal. A general view of the office building that used to be occupied by the now defunct Cambridge Analytica on May 2, 2018 in London, England. Photo: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nCambridge Analytica came under fire for allegedly misusing Facebook user data while it was providing data assistance to President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. The firm was accused of using the data of tens of millions of Facebook users to influence their votes.\n\nAll of that came to light in March, prompting a wave of criticism for both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and leading Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in front of Congress about the site's privacy and safety features. Since then, Facebook has announced and released a handful of features to supposedly help protect user data.\n\nThe closure of Cambridge Analytica came less than two months after the suspension of CEO Alexander Nix. Nix was caught on video discussing the use of things like entrapment and bribery in its favor. He also took credit for Trump's presidential victory through the use of data.\n\nThough this scandal spelled the end of Cambridge Analytica, Facebook appears to have survived the storm. The social media giant's most recent earnings report indicated rising revenues and user growth.",

Kogan initially collected the data for research, but later said he informed users of his intention to sell the data.\n\nThe data collection was first reported a couple of years ago, but media reports in mid-March -- bolstered by claims by a former Cambridge Analytica employee -- blew the scandal wide open and moved Facebook's handling of user data into the spotlight once again.\n\nCambridge Analytica was funded by Republican donor Robert Mercer and once had Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist, as its vice president. The firm used psychometrics -- which nowadays involves building psychological profiles partly based on people's social media activity -- to try to influence the way people vote. The campaigns of President Trump and others used Cambridge Analytica data.\n\nDespite the official shutdown, though, the Mercer family and executives at Cambridge Analytica and SCL have moved to create a new firm called Emerdata in recent months, the New York Times reports, citing British records. The newspaper also reported that its anonymous sources said those officials are considering selling off the combined company's data and intellectual property.\n\nCambridge Analytica has not responded to a request for comment Thursday about what will happen to the data it collected. Last month, contrary to the media reports that brought the scandal to light, it said deleted the data it had obtained from GSR (Kogan's firm) after being told by Facebook that it was improperly collected, and was \"searching for and removing any of its derivatives in our system.\"",

We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\"\n\nBut Cambridge Analytica's announcement left several questions unanswered, including who would retain the company's intellectual property - the so-called psychographic voter profiles built in part with data from Facebook - and whether Cambridge Analytica's data-mining business would return under new auspices.\n\nIn recent months, executives at Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group have moved to create a new firm, Emerdata, based in Britain, according to British records.\n\nNYTIMES, WASHINGTON POST, REUTERS",

The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nFacebook said it will keep looking into data misuse by Cambridge Analytica even though the firm is closing down. And Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group in Washington, said criticisms of Facebook's privacy practices won't go away just because Cambridge Analytica has.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica's practices, although it crossed ethical boundaries, is really emblematic of how data-driven digital marketing occurs worldwide,\" Chester said. \"Rather than rejoicing that a bad actor has met its just reward, we should recognize that many more Cambridge Analytica-like companies are operating in the conjoined commercial and political marketplace.\"\n\nFacebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress last month. Facebook also has suspended other companies for using similar tactics. One is Cubeyou, which makes personality quizzes. That company has said it did nothing wrong and is seeking reinstatement.\n\nCambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix in March pending an investigation after Nix boasted of various unsavory services to an undercover reporter for Britain's Channel 4 News. Channel 4 News broadcast clips that showed Nix saying his data-mining firm played a major role in securing Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nActing CEO Alexander Tayler also stepped down in April and returned to his previous post as chief data officer.\n\nCambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data. On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica said an outside investigation it commissioned concluded the allegations were not \"borne out by the facts.\"\n\nFacebook's audit of the firm has been suspended while U.K. regulators conduct their own probe. But Facebook says Cambridge Analytica's decision to close \"doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"",

But \"shutting down\" may not mean much -- many of that company's principal players are associated with a new data company called Emerdata.\n\nEmerdata was incorporated in the UK in August 2017 and registered under the same address as Cambridge Analytica in London's Canary Wharf. The board of directors includes Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of the hedge-fund billionaire and primary Cambridge Analytica investor Robert Mercer. Both were appointed to the board on March 15.\n\nAlexander Nix, the Cambridge Analytica CEO who was suspended after he was taped boasting that the firm employed bribery and extortion on political candidates, was originally listed as a director of Emerdata. But he resigned on March 28 and was replaced by Alex Tayler, Cambridge Analytica's chief data officer and acting CEO.\n\nNix had also registered a company called Firecrest Technologies but resigned and was replaced there by Tayler on March 7.\n\nOn Medium, journalist Wendy Siegelman compiled an org chart of Emerdata, illustrating how several of the Cambridge Analytica principals are involved. They include Julian Wheatland, chairman of Cambridge Analytica parent firm SCL Group, and Trump supporter Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater and brother-in-law of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\nOn March 23, the UK's Channel 4 News reported that Emerdata was set up to acquire Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL Group, according to Nigel Oakes, founder of SCL. In the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Oakes said that both SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica were \"closing down.\"\n\nThe timing of the \"shutdown\" may have something to do with ongoing hearings in the UK's Parliament about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and whether the company helped bad actors interfere in the Brexit referendum. On Wednesday, a data expert testified that Cambridge Analytica used psychological insights derived from Facebook in the Trump campaign.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Guardian reporter Carole Cadwalladr shared a screenshot of a legal letter the Guardian had been sent by Cambridge Analytica earlier in the year, which stated that the company had \"no employees and very few assets\" -- that it was, in essence, a shell company.\n\nIn addition to primarily funding Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer funds the Make American #1 PAC, which paid Cambridge Analytica $1.5 million during 2015 and 2016. In March, the Washington Post reported that future presidential adviser and Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon oversaw Cambridge Analytica's data collection and had tested Trump slogans such as \"drain the swamp\" and \"deep state\" well before Trump deployed them during the campaign.",

This is due to the Facebook privacy scandal that leads their board members to decide that they will be shutting it down. After the infamous Facebook privacy scandal, the legal fees of Cambridge Analytica was mounting higher and higher and the clients started to leave this firm in the wake of revelations about its use of Facebook data.\n\nBack in 2014, Cambridge Analytica exploited the privacy settings of many of the Facebook users to scrape data on the non-consenting friends of people who used a certain personality quiz app. This is not the end of the story though. Cambridge Analytica is said to have scraped personal data of as many as 87 million people even though they had not used the personality quiz app. It was reported later that only 300,000 people gave their permission to share their data.\n\nRelated\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has admitted his mistake and was still called to appear before the U.S Senate hearing to provide explanations. With the help of this data, the firm built a \"psychographic\" profile of U.S voters to help the campaign of the current President Donald Trump. The Russian government has also been accused of having to play a part in this scam. However, Trump's campaign is now under investigation for alleged collusion with the Russian government. The Cambridge Scandal has prompted government investigations of the U.S and in Europe.\n\nOne of the Cambridge Analytica officials has released a statement saying, \"With mounting legal fees and vanishing clients in the wake of revelations about its use of Facebook data, political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and its British parent company, SCL Elections, are shutting down. The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers, as a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\" They have also mentioned that, \"the subject of numerous unfounded accusations, and vilified for activities that are not only legal but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\"\n\nVia: AppleInsider",

      "title": "Cambridge Analytica is dead - but its obscure network is alive and well",
      "body": "The company's executives have formed a web of linked companies, suggesting its work will continue\n\nThe announcement that Cambridge Analytica is shutting has a certain inevitability to it. Ever since 17 March 2018, when Carole Cadwalladr broke Christopher Wylie's whistleblower story at the Observer and in the New York Times, there have been continuous revelations about Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, and their brazen use - or misuse - of Facebook data and dirty tricks.\n\nBut given the complex business structure of SCL and Cambridge Analytica's UK and US affiliates, there are reasons to question precisely what Wednesday's announcement means. Already there are some suggestions that those associated with Cambridge Analytica may re-emerge in another form.\n\nAre Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group attempting to evade recent negative coverage, only to re-form and continue their work as part of a new entity?\n\nDamian Collins, the British MP who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport Committee that is investigating SCL and Cambridge Analytica, tweeted some words of caution on Wednesday after the news broke, noting that CA and SCL \"cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing\".\n\nCertainly the news presents as many questions as answers.\n\nCambridge Analytica and SCL have at least 18 active companies, branches, and affiliates with similar names, based in the UK and the US. The complex relationship among these companies makes it very difficult to understand how revenues, employment, and data are shared. It almost seems as though the business structure was created to make it impossible to track decision-making and funding.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon Cambridge Analytica issued a press release stating: \"SCL Elections Ltd., as well as certain of its and Cambridge Analytica LLC's U.K. affiliates (collectively, the 'Company' or 'Cambridge Analytica') filed applications to commence insolvency proceedings in the U.K.\" It also stated that \"parallel bankruptcy proceedings will soon be commenced on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC and certain of the Company's U.S. affiliates in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\"\n\nIt is notable that Cambridge Analytica's press release does not mention SCL Group Limited, SCL Social Ltd, or SCL Insight Ltd. Is it closing only some affiliates and leaving others open?\n\nShortly after the whistleblower story on Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data broke in March, the Cambridge Analytica CEO, Alexander Nix, was suspended and three US states opened investigations into Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. In the following weeks, current and past employees of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified in the UK, the US, Canada and other countries, and a US and UK class action lawsuit was filed against both companies in early April.\n\nHowever, reporting on Cambridge Analytica - from Cadwalladr and others - had begun to appear in 2015 and 2016 and intensified throughout 2017. While Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group began to be the focus of more media scrutiny, in the background, company executives were quietly setting up a new company. Emerdata Limited was incorporated in August 2017 with SCL Group's chairman, Julian Wheatland, and SCL's chief data officer, Alexander Tayler, as original owners, but the company suddenly expanded with new directors and funding this year.\n\nOn 23 January 2018, four new directors were appointed to Emerdata, including Johnson Chun Shun Ko, who happens to be deputy chairman of Frontier Services Group. On the same day that Ko joined the board of Emerdata, shares were issued valued at £1,912,502. On 7 March 2018, Firecrest Technologies Limited was incorporated, with Alexander Nix listed briefly as director and then replaced by Alexander Tayler, and Emerdata listed as the owner. And on 16 March, a few days before the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower story broke, two more directors joined Emerdata, Jennifer and Rebekah Mercer.\n\nThere has been much reporting on how Robert and Rebekah Mercer have funded US political action committees (Pacs) that have paid Cambridge Analytica, but there had been little public evidence showing a current legal or business connection from the Mercers to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe business purpose of Emerdata is not known, beyond the general description of \"data processing, hosting and related activities\". However, in a Channel 4 News report, the SCL Group founder, Nigel Oakes, said it was his understanding that Emerdata was set up to acquire all of Cambridge Analytica and SCL.\n\nEmerdata did not respond to multiple requests for comment sent to several company directors.\n\nThe news Wednesday about the closure of Cambridge Analytica does not mention Emerdata or its subsidiary Firecrest Technologies. And just one day earlier, on Tuesday, the UK Companies House website posted an update on Emerdata, noting two pending filings, for \"Resolution of removal of pre-emption rights\" and \"Resolution of allotment of securities\". The documents are being processed and will be available in five days. Perhaps these filings will show that the company is dissolving, or perhaps they will be the standard filings of an active company. All of the other UK SCL-related companies are still listed as active and have no pending filings.\n\nThe beleaguered Nix is still listed as an active director and shareholder of SCL Group and many of the related companies. Wednesday's news is big, but it is not clear yet what it means, and whether SCL, Cambridge Analytica, Emerdata and the same executives who ran these companies during the Brexit campaign and US election will re-emerge in a new entity to continue their work.",

As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.\"\n\nFacebook suspended Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group from the platform in mid-March, hours before British newspaper The Guardian published a report from a whistleblower detailing how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained Facebook user data. A researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality app in 2014 called thisisyourdigitallife, which paid hundreds of thousands of users to take a personality quiz, in exchange for some of their Facebook data. At the time, the app also gave Kogan access to some data from the friends of the users who took that quiz. The app was created before Facebook changed its policies on the amount of data app developers could collect.\n\nKogan then gave that data to Cambridge Analytica, violating Facebook's policies. Facebook sent a letter to Cambridge Analytica telling them to destroy the data in August 2016, but didn't follow up to ensure that the firm did so. The Guardian reported that Cambridge Analytica then used that data to create \"psychological profiles\" of U.S. voters for ad targeting. Cambridge Analytica was employed by Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-TX) campaign during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, and then by President Donald Trump once Cruz ended his bid.\n\nThe instance became the poster child for Facebook's failure to properly protect user data, and prompted Congress to call Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in front of various committees.",

      "title": "The six weeks that brought Cambridge Analytica down",
      "body": "In December 2015, the Guardian revealed that Ted Cruz's presidential campaign was using psychological profiles based on data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users. The organisation that assembled the data was at the time described as a \"little-known data company\" called Cambridge Analytica, a name now synonymous with efforts to use Facebook data to try and influence election outcomes worldwide.\n\nThis week, Cambridge Analytica announced that it, along with SCL Elections, the UK entity owned by the former CEO Alexander Nix, was shutting down over mounting legal fees and what it described as a \"siege of media coverage\" that drove away \"virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers\". The company - which was created with an initial $15m investment from the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer - maintains it has done nothing wrong and has been killed by negative PR. No announcement has been made about the fate of the parent company, SCL Group, a UK defence contractor which has been in business for 30 years.\n\nThe beginning of the end for the data analytics firm was on Saturday 17 March, when the Observer and the New York Times published interviews with the whistleblower Christopher Wylie.\n\nThis followed more than a year's worth of reporting on the company by the Observer. The first piece, in February last year, triggered two legal investigations, both of which are continuing: one by the Electoral Commission into what work the company did for Nigel Farage's Leave.EU campaign and whether it had been properly declared, and the other by the Information Commissioner's Office, which also announced a wider inquiry into the use of data in politics.\n\nWylie detailed how the software program at the heart of Cambridge Analytica was created, and how the company collected the data of tens of millions of Facebook users for commercial use, in violation of the social media giant's own rules.\n\n\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on,\" he said.\n\nBy late 2015, Facebook found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale, but at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.\n\nCambridge Analytica went on to work for Donald Trump's campaign, and its executives would later claim to undercover reporters that the company played a pivotal role in his victory.\n\nFacebook attempted to dampen the impact of Wylie's whistleblowing interviews by publishing its own mea culpa and banning Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group from its platform, hours before publication but two years after the data breach was first reported.\n\nIt argued it had asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the Facebook data after the Guardian's 2015 article and had taken the company's word when it said it had done this.\n\nWhen the stories came out they prompted international outrage, and made Cambridge Analytica an unlikely household name. And so started six weeks of pain for the firm.\n\nThe day after Wylie's bombshell revelations, US congressional investigators from the house intelligence committee asked Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Nix, to testify before Congress. They also summoned Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to explain the data breach.\n\nOn Monday 19 March, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data watchdog, requested a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers and ordered Facebook's \"digital forensics team\", which had gone to its offices to secure evidence, to stand down, arguing that a Facebook audit could potentially compromise a regulatory investigation.\n\nThat evening the UK's Channel 4 News broadcast secret recordings in which Nix boasted of using honey traps, fake news campaigns and operations with former spies to swing election campaigns around the world.\n\nThe following day, Nix was suspended from the company. A second undercover report showed Cambridge Analytica executives boasted of playing a key role in bringing Trump to power, and claiming they used \"unattributable and untrackable\" advertising to support their clients in elections.\n\n\"We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,\" Nix told an undercover reporter when asked about Trump's campaign.\n\nOn Friday 23 March, after a wait for the warrant, 18 investigators from the ICO spent seven hours searching Cambridge Analytica's London offices.\n\nA second former Cambridge Analytica employee, Brittany Kaiser, also went on the record to reveal further details of the company's inner workings to the Guardian.\n\nOn Sunday 25 March, Wylie spoke about Cambridge Analytica connections to AggregateIQ, a Canadian firm that worked with different leave campaigns in the European referendum.\n\nSoon afterwards, US watchdogs filed a legal complaint against Cambridge Analytica with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThey accused the company of potentially violating US election law, by employing non-American citizens to work on American election campaigns, despite receiving a legal warning about the risks.\n\nWith anger mounting about Facebook's silence, and 10 days after the initial reports were published, Zuckerberg agreed to testify to the US Congress about the data breach. He has refused repeated requests from the UK's parliament to answer questions, and MPs are now threatening him with summons if he does not come voluntarily to testify.\n\nMeanwhile, Wylie began hours of testimony to a UK parliamentary select committee, in which he claimed Cambridge Analytica sought to disrupt elections around the world, including distributing violent videos in Nigeria.\n\nHe also alleged there was coordination in the Brexit campaign between Vote Leave and BeLeave, bringing into question the legitimacy of a £625,000 donation which was received by AggregateIQ.\n\nVote Leave has repeatedly denied coordination between the campaigns and said the donation was legitimate under election law.\n\nFacebook suspended AggregateIQ, a data firm with which the Vote Leave campaign spent 40% of its budget, on 6 April, following reports that it was connected to SCL.\n\nAggregateIQ has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. It maintains it is 100% Canadian owned and operated, and not a direct part or branch of Cambridge Analytica. Jeff Silvester, founder of AggregateIQ, said that Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with the company during the referendum campaign. \"AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign,\" he said. \"Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.\"\n\nBy 10 April, British and US lawyers had launched a joint class action against Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and SCL for allegedly misusing the personal data of more than 71 million people. The lawsuit claims the firms obtained users' private information from the social network to develop \"political propaganda campaigns\" in the UK and the US.\n\nThat same week, Zuckerberg faced 10 hours of questioning by members of Congress. He remained calm and composed, showing remorse and deference and highlighting the changes Facebook had already made. He pledged to do more to protect privacy and prevent foreign interference in elections.\n\nNix was summoned to appear before a British parliamentary committee on fake news the following week for questioning over \"inconsistencies\" in evidence he had given the committee in February, when he claimed: \"We do not work with Facebook data, and we do not have Facebook data.\" However, on 17 April he cancelled his appearance, citing the ICO's ongoing investigation into his company.\n\nDamian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee said: \"We do not accept Mr Nix's reason for not appearing in a public session before the committee.\n\n\"There is ... no legal reason why Mr Nix cannot appear.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica held a press conference on Tuesday 24 April, in which it stated that the data it licensed from the academic Aleksandr Kogan's company Global Science Research was \"ineffectual\" and therefore it did not use it in Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSpokesman Clarence Mitchell said the company tested to see if Kogan's personality types could improve the performance of advertising campaigns but that that they \"underperformed when compared to more traditional ways of grouping people by demographics\".\n\nThe damage was already done. Cambridge Analytica's clients and suppliers had, the company said, jumped ship after the firm was \"vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas\".\n\nOn 2 May, the same day that Cambridge Analytica announced it was going into liquidation, Chris Vickery of the data security firm Upguard gave evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport committee that the Trump campaign had access to psychological profiles derived from Facebook data, that AIQ and Cambridge Analytica were technologically entwined and that illegal co-ordination of data by leave campaigns was \"indisputable\".\n\nAlthough Cambridge Analytica might be dead, the team behind it has already set up a new company called Emerdata. According to Companies House data, Alexander Nix is listed as a director along with other executives from SCL Group.",

      "body": "LONDON, May 3 -- Cambridge Analytica, the firm embroiled in a controversy over its handling of Facebook Inc user data, and its British parent SCL Elections Ltd, are shutting down immediately after suffering a sharp drop in business, the company said yesterday.\n\nThe company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014.\n\n\"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers,\" the statement said.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\"\n\nAllegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump's 2016 US election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world's biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company's statement said.\n\nThe firm is shutting down effective yesterday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices yesterday. At SCL's Washington, D.C. office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter.\n\nAfter the announcement, Britain's data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue \"individuals and directors as appropriate\" despite the shutdown.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\" a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said in a statement.\n\nCambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on US elections, with US$15 million (RM59 million) in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.\n\nCambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.\n\nAfter Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \"secret sauce\" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.\n\nOne unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia's Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive.\n\nBannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation. -- Reuters",

      "body": "In a statement, the company defended itself in the face of the controversy and said an internal investigation had not found any wrongdoing.\n\nBritish firm Cambridge Analytica, which is embroiled in a controversy over mishandling Facebook user data, on Wednesday said it is shutting down operations along with its parent organisation, SCL Elections Limited, citing losses.\n\nCambridge Analytica is under scrutiny for allegedly harvesting the information of over 70 million Facebook users to influence the outcome of the United States presidential election in 2016. Earlier in April, parliamentarians in the United Kingdom published evidence about Brexit campaign group Leave.EU benefiting from work done by the firm.\n\nThe company said it is immediately ceasing all operations of Cambridge Analytica and will soon begin bankruptcy proceedings. Insolvency proceedings for SCL Elections will soon begin, it added.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,\" the company said in a statement. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica continued to defend itself and said an internal investigation had not found any wrongdoing. \"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" it said.\n\nInvestigators, however, said the probe into the controversy will continue. \"We have got to make sure this is not at attempt to run and hide, that these companies are not closing down to try to avoid them being rigorously investigated over the allegations that are being made against them,\" Damian Collins, chair of the Commons select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, told BBC.\n\nBritain's Information Commissioner's Office said it will continue to pursue individuals and directors as appropriate despite the shutdown, Reuters reported. \"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg had told a committee of the United States Senate that Cambridge Analytica had illegally used his personal data too. Zuckerberg had also apologised for failing to protect the personal information of millions of people.\n\nSoon after the data breach was reported, whistleblower Christopher Wylie said Cambridge Analytica had worked on several projects in India too. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in April sent notices to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. In its notice to Facebook, the government asked for details of the security measures undertaken to ensure \"data concerning Indians are not pilfered or manipulated again for extraneous purposes including to influence the elections\".",

The last date for the two companies to respond is May 10.\n\nYesterday, however, Cambridge Analytica announced its closure in a statement on its website and claimed it had been \"vilified\" for activities that are legal and considered a standard component of online advertising.\n\nIndian officials familiar with the questioning and notices sent in the data leak matter said the ongoing probe will continue as the liability of the company existed prior to the closure announcement.\n\nThey, however, declined to divulge further details in the matter, saying that both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have time till May 10 to send written responses to official questioning.\n\nIn fresh notice sent to Cambridge Analytica last month, the government asked what kind of data was collected in India and the research instruments used to capture such data. It also asked whether the company harvested any data through third party apps and whether or not mining of such data was done with user consent.\n\nQuizzing the British firm on the non-disclosure pacts signed by the company with its associates and clients for Indian assignments, the government also asked it to share the templates that were used in signing such agreements.\n\nThe latest notice by the government had also flagged the \"cryptic and evasive\" reply given by Cambridge Analytica to the first notice.\n\nOn the other hand, the notice to Facebook had taken note of the US social networking company's candid admission of unauthorised use of its user data by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook was asked to list out the security architecture proposed to be created \"so that data concerning Indians are not pilfered or manipulated again for extraneous purposes including to influence the elections\".\n\nWhile Facebook had previously admitted that nearly 5.62 lakh people in India were \"potentially affected\" by the data breach incident, Cambridge Analytica had claimed that it does not have any Facebook data on Indian citizens.\n\nThe British firm yesterday said it is shutting down and cited a sharp drop in business behind its decision.\n\nIn its statement, Cambridge Analytica said, \"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas\".",

At SCL's Washington, D.C. office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter.\n\nAfter the announcement, Britain's data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue \"individuals and directors as appropriate\" despite the shutdown.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\" a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said in a statement.\n\nCambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million (£11 million) in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.\n\nCambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.\n\nAfter Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \"secret sauce\" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.\n\nOne unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia's Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive.\n\nBannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.\n\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington, Andy Bruce in London and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Writing by John Whitesides; Editing by Patrick Graham and Bill Rigby)",

      "body": "Has Cambridge Analytica simply rebranded as Emerdata Limited?\n\nCambridge Analytica is no more. The firm at the centre of the Facebook data scandal that saw Mark Zuckerberg gently prodded by Congress announced it is shutting up shop for good.\n\nThis isn't, the firm was keen to stress, any admission of wrongdoing. In fact, the company put out a rather bullish statement arguing that it only engaged in standard campaigning practices - which may very well be true, but doesn't necessarily inspire confidence at the resilience of democracy in a digital age.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company wrote.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers. As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.\"\n\nIts parent company SCL Elections is also apparently entering into bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nFacebook, for its part is not giving up the chase. \"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" a spokesperson said. \"We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\"\n\nGone in all but name?\n\nAmusingly, if you do a Google search for Cambridge Analytica, alongside a bunch of news stories, you get user-generated reviews of the company averaging a 1.6/5 star rating.\n\nFunny as these reviews are, they point to a wider problem. When Christopher Wylie blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica, very few people had heard of the company - and that's as you'd expect. Political campaigning outfits are designed to exist only behind the scenes: to be heard, but not seen. If they're known by name to the public at large, then that's almost certainly for the wrong reasons, and so it has come to pass with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nEven taking the company at its word that it acted within the law, in an age where trust in elected officials is at an all-time low, it would take a very brave election campaign to enlist its services.\n\nBut seeing as it's likely 99.9% of people had never heard of Cambridge Analytica before the scandal unfolded, and almost none of those who now have could name any other political consultancy, could the company rebrand?\n\nWylie, for his part, suggests this to be highly likely:\n\nREMEMBER: Cambridge Analytica specialises in disinformation! We need to make sure their shut down is not just some rebranding or a way to hide from investigations. The SAME PEOPLE set up ANOTHER COMPANY and yesterday issued new company resolutions! Smells fishy af pic.twitter.com/o0ox3AeGL0\n\n-- Christopher Wylie (@chrisinsilico) May 2, 2018\n\nAnd sure enough, a company with a remarkably similar set of faces has already been spotted. On the Companies House website, there's a business called Emerdata Limited which lists its HQ as the same offices as SCL Elections and hired Alexander Taylor as a director on 28 March 2018. Taylor was previously acting CEO of Cambridge Analytica. He replaced Alexander Nix at Emerdata, who resigned the same day. You may remember Nix: he was the man suspended from Cambridge Analytica after Channel 4 secretly recording him making some dubious boasts about the company's work.\n\nVideo of Cambridge Analytica Uncovered: Secret filming reveals election tricks\n\nElsewhere, Julian Wheatland is listed as another Emerdata director - something he has experience of from his day job of being on the SCL board. Joining him on the Emerdata board are Jennifer and Rebekah Mercer, daughters of Robert Mercer, who created and funded Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAnd what does Emerdata Limited do? Companies House lists it as a \"data processing, hosting and related activities\" business, which is vague, but the same kind of vague description as could legally describe an outfit like Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThis article originally appeared at alphr.com",

      "body": "Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy at the centre of the Facebook data-sharing scandal, is shutting down.\n\nThe firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients.\n\nAccording to Facebook, data about up to 87 million of its members was harvested by a quiz app and then passed on to the political consultancy.\n\nThe social network said its own probe into the matter would continue.\n\n\"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" said a spokesman.\n\n\"We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\"\n\nWhat are the accusations against Cambridge Analytica?\n\nThe company has been accused of using the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum.\n\nIn March, Channel 4 aired undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix, giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps.\n\nThe UK-based company, which denies any wrongdoing, has an extensive record of working abroad on many election campaigns, including in Italy, Kenya and Nigeria.\n\nWhy does it say it is shutting?\n\nClarence Mitchell, a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica, referred the BBC to a statement on the firm's website.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" it said.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.\"\n\nThe statement added that its parent company SCL Elections was also commencing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe sting in the tail\n\nWhen the news of Cambridge Analytica's demise broke here at Facebook's F8 developer conference, it is safe to say few tears were shed.\n\nThe scandal over data misuse has been a crisis not just for Facebook but for the thousands of external developers whose access to data has been curbed in response to the affair.\n\nBut if they were tempted to celebrate there was a sting in the tail in the political consultancy's statement. It claimed that what it did was not only legal but was standard practice in the world of online advertising.\n\nThat rang true to some people in this world and there may be more evidence of such practices as Facebook continues its audit of apps.\n\nCambridge Analytica may be gone but as more stones are lifted there may be more unpleasant surprises to come about the use and misuse of personal data.\n\nIs this the end?\n\nThe UK's Financial Times newspaper says it has spoken to another ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica, on condition of anonymity, who said they were sure the company would emerge \"in some other incarnation or guise\".\n\nThe Observer journalist whose investigation first exposed the data privacy scandal has suggested that the public remain sceptical.\n\nThe chair of a UK parliament committee investigating the firm's activities also raised concerns about Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections' move.\n\n\"They are party to very serious investigations and those investigations cannot be impeded by the closure of these companies,\" said Damian Collins MP.\n\n\"I think it's absolutely vital that the closure of these companies is not used as an excuse to try and limit or restrict the ability of the authorities to investigate what they were doing.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica's chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended in March after the Channel 4 News footage was aired.\n\nLast month, Cambridge Analytica said it had only licensed 30 million records belonging to US citizens from the quiz app's creator Dr Aleksandr Kogan, and that they had not been used in the US presidential election.\n\nThe firm added that it had since deleted all the information despite claims to the contrary by others.\n\nOne of Cambridge Analytica's major investors is the US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer.\n\nHe is said to have put $15m (£11m) into the business, according to the Guardian.\n\nMr Mercer, a former computer scientist, is also a major donor to the US Republican Party and helped support Donald Trump's election campaign.\n\nHe has never given an interview about his political views and is not thought to have commented publicly about the data-harvesting scandal.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, a cyber-security specialist presented evidence to the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.\n\nChris Vickery linked SCL and Cambridge Analytica to AggregateIQ - a Canadian data analytics firm, which Facebook has also suspended from using its platform.\n\nHe added that \"beyond a shadow of a doubt\" AggregateIQ had been involved in \"some form of collaboration or co-ordination\" between various pro-Brexit groups during the UK's EU referendum campaign.\n\nAIQ denies ever being part of Cambridge Analytica, its parent company SCL or accessing improperly obtained Facebook data.\n\nAnd representatives from Vote Leave and Leave.EU have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBut the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office are conducting their own investigations into the Canadian firm's operations.\n\nThe ICO has also issued a statement about Cambridge Analytica's closure.\n\n\"The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to pursue individuals and directors as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating,\" it said.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded.\"\n\n17 March: The Observer and the New York Times publish accounts by Cambridge Analytica's ex-employee Christopher Wylie, saying 50 million Facebook accounts were improperly harvested by the company\n\n23 March: The UK's data watchdog is granted a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office\n\n27 March: Christopher Wylie appears in front of a committee of UK MPs\n\n4 April: Facebook says it now believes up to 87 million people's data was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica\n\n10 April: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is questioned by US lawmakers about the scandal\n\n17 April: Alexander Nix, the former boss of Cambridge Analytica, refuses to appear before British MPs\n\n26 April: The UK parliamentary committee threatens to issue Mark Zuckerberg with a \"formal summons for him to appear when he is next in the UK\" as questions remain unanswered",

      "body": "London: MPs in Britain have reacted with fury to the news that scandal hit Cambridge Analytica has shut down after declaring itself bankrupt in an alleged attempt to prevent an investigation into how it exploited data harvested from 87 million Facebook users.\n\nDamian Collins, a Tory MP who is chairman of the Commons select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, tweeted: \"Cambridge Analytica and (its parent company) SCL Group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing.\"\n\n\"The investigations into their work are vital,\" he insisted. Collins has repeated a request for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to appear before his committee, claiming evidence provided by the firm's chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer sent in his place last week \"failed to answer fully\" almost 40 questions.\n\nCambridge Analytica, a US-firm once retained by Facebook, shut down its operations on Wednesday citing loss of business and, as a symbolic gesture, even removed its nameplate from the central London offices that it had occupied.\n\nBut British MPs see all this as a ruse to frustrate an investigation into its activities. Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing but has been accused of interfering in the US elections and the Brexit referendum in 2016.\n\nHowever, nothing illegal has been found about the work it apparently did for the Congress Party in India.\n\nCollins told the BBC that Cambridge Analytica would not be allowed to escape the consequences of any illegal activities.\n\n\"We've got to make sure this isn't at attempt to run and hide, that these companies are not closing down to try to avoid them being rigorously investigated over the allegations that are being made against them,\" he said.\n\nHe was backed by Labour MP Mary Creagh, who reacted angrily to Cambridge Analytica's decision to declare itself bankrupt. \"Outrageous,\" she summed up. \"Insolvency used to cover up illegality.\"\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office also served notice that Cambridge Analytica would be held to account.\n\nIt said: \"The ICO has been investigating the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica as part of a wider investigation into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns, social media companies and others. We will be examining closely the details of the announcements of the winding down of Cambridge Analytica and the status of its parent company.\n\n\"The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to pursue individuals and directors as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica took everyone by surprise by announcing it was putting itself out of business. The company said in a statement: \"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\"",

      "body": "BRITISH company Cambridge Analytica became engulfed in a Facebook data scandal which put the social media giant in the spotlight on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHere's what we know about data firm Cambridge Analytica, the Facebook data breach and the company's board of directors.\n\nCambridge Analytica is a London-based company that helps business and political groups \"change audience behaviour\".\n\nThey muster up data on voters through their internet-use. This data is then analysed and packaged so that political spin doctors can create more effective slogans and campaign messages.\n\nThe company was only set up in 2013, launching as a spin-off project from parent company SCL Group.\n\nIt collects data from sources including social media platforms like Facebook.\n\nOn May 2, 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported the firm was to close.\n\nThe report cites concerns of the company over legal fees and the loss of clients following the data scandal.\n\nCambridge Analytica is yet to comment on the reports it is shutting down.\n\nCambridge Analytica inappropriately gained access to data from 50 million Facebook users in the US.\n\nThis data was used to help get their client Donald Trump elected.\n\nThe alleged breach came to light thanks to a Cambridge Analytica whistleblower called Christopher Wylie.\n\nHe said: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles\".\n\nFacebook said the 87 million users whose data might have been shared with the political firm would get a message on their feeds.\n\nIt said most of the affected users are in the US, though there are over a million each in the Philippines, Indonesia and the UK.\n\nThere are around 40million Facebook users in Britain, so that means you have a roughly 1 in 40 chance of having had your data hoovered up without your knowledge.\n\nFacebook's Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer revealed shared the number while discussing the steps the company was taking to restrict the personal data available to third-party app developers.\n\n\"And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.\n\n\"That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"\n\nThe data analysis firm's London offices have since been searched by police amid widespread concern over its work.\n\nMozilla was among the first major organisations to stop advertising on Facebook in response to concerns over the protection it offered to users' data.\n\nThe company said it is \"pressing pause\" on Facebook advertising at least until the social network strengthens its safeguarding.\n\nA Cambridge psychology professor called Aleksandr Kogan built an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" in 2015.\n\nIt was a personality quiz that asked Facebook users to provide information about themselves.\n\nThrough his company Global Science Research, Kogan shared the info obtained from the app with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nOnly 270,000 Facebook users actually signed up and took personality tests.\n\nBut the app also harvested data of all the Facebook friends connected to those users, without the permission of those friends.\n\nFacebook reportedly knew about the data harvesting in 2015, and asked companies holding the data to delete it - but had no way of making sure that they actually did so.\n\nThis dodgy data harvesting may be illegal in a number of countries, and violates Facebook's own data policy.\n\nEuropean Parliament president Antonio Tajani said: \"Allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens' privacy rights.\n\n\"The European Parliament will investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account.\"\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused requests from British MPs to explain its response to the scandal.\n\nHe instead said he \"personally asked\" one of his deputies to attend.\n\nIn the US, the government opened a privacy investigation into the social media giant.\n\nRelated: How to download all your Facebook data\n\nOn April 9, Zuckerberg apologised for \"not doing enough\" to protect Facebook users data being misused.\n\nIt came in written testimony to US lawmakers, in which he admitted Facebook was slow to spot Russian election hacking, but he did not reveal new information.\n\nIn the prepared remarks, Zuckerberg, 33, said Facebook has a responsibility to make sure what happened with Cambridge Analytica doesn't happen again.\n\nHe said: \"We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that10 was a big mistake.\n\n\"It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica is part of SCL Group, with whom it shares some of its directors.\n\nAlexander Nix, 42, is CEO of both Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections, but was suspended after comments he made about entrapping clients' rivals with Ukrainian prostitutes were broadcast by Channel 4.\n\nMark Turnbull is managing director of Cambridge Analytica's political division.\n\nMr Turnbull spent 18 years at communications firm Bell Pottinger before he joined SCL.\n\nThe co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign Arron Banks said that Cambridge Analytica helped with pro-Brexit campaigns during the run-up to the 2016 referendum.\n\nBut Cambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix denies this.\n\nInstead, Nix says the companies only had exploratory meetings.\n\n\"We didn't get hitched. We dated each other. We had a couple of dinners but we didn't get married,\" he told MPs at the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee for an investigation into fake news.\n\nBut in his book on the EU referendum, Banks said that Cambridge Analytica was \"hired\" in 2015 to \"develop messages\" for voters.\n\nHowever, Nix maintains that Cambridge Analytica \"did not work for Leave.EU\", and added: \"We have not undertaken any paid nor unpaid work for them.\"\n\n\"I can only assume that they felt by associating themselves and aligning themselves with Cambridge Analytica, that would give the extra credibility and leverage in trying to compete in a bid where they were clearly the underdogs.\"",

The controversial data firm that worked on US President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, as well as its parent company, SCL Elections Ltd, has announced it would begin bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe political consulting firm, which was at the centre of the Facebook privacy scandal, lamented that it has been \"vilified\" in the past months for its actions that were apparently both legal and accepted. The media and public outcry unfortunately scared off its customers and suppliers, it said, leaving it with no other choice than to go into administration.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the company said in a sentence.\n\n\"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,\" it continued. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\"\n\nIt shut down operations in its London offices on Wednesday, with its employees being told to turn in their computers.\n\nAccording to Wall Street Journal, Cambridge Analytica hired investigator Julian Malins to prove the firm did not engage in any wrongdoing in its work on political campaigns. Malin's report, Cambridge Analytica claimed, said that its employees had acted ethically and lawfully. But despite the investigator's findings, the media still sought to disparage the company. Legal fees were apparently one of the reasons why it collapsed.\n\nIn March, UK's Channel 4 News published its sting operation showing Cambridge Analytica executives boasting about working on over 200 elections around the world. CEO Alexander Nix was recorded in the footage saying that his company used malicious practices for opposition research.\n\nCambridge Analytica was created in 2013 to focus initially on US elections. It was apparently the force behind Trump's win in the presidential election in 2016. It sought information on Facebook using an app that garnered information not only of those who used the app, but also their friends network. This resulted in information-gathering of about 50 million users. Facebook has since been the subject of privacy scandals.",

The British firm suspended CEO Alexander Tayler in April amid investigations.\n\nCambridge Analytica sought information on Facebook to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U.S. electorate. The company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that appeared to be a personality test. The app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends, even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nFacebook has since tightened its privacy restrictions. Cambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data.\n\nThe firm has said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation into Facebook and how it uses data. But U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in March the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested.\n\nDenham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

      "title": "Hawaii rocked by strongest quake in 40 years as Kilauea volcano sparks fountains of lava",
      "body": "series of fresh earthquakes on Friday, including a powerful magnitude 6.9, hit Hawaii's Big Island, where the Kilauea volcano has been spewing fountains of lava into residential areas and forcing hundreds to evacuate.\n\nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) said the strongest tremor at 12.32 pm measured 6.9, the island's largest earthquake in more than 40 years.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said the quake, whose epicentre was on the south flank of the volcano, was not large enough to cause a tsunami although it generated sea level changes around the island of up 40 cm.\n\nIt caused buildings to shake at the Community Centre in Pahoa town, one of two evacuation centres in the area hastily set up after lava started burbling up through fissures in the ground in neighbourhoods nearby.\n\nA new fissure opened up just before the latest tremor on Friday in one of those neighbourhoods, Leilani Estates, about a dozen miles from the volcano, the Hawaii County Civil Defence Agency said, making a total of four found so far.\n\nKilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes and one of five on the island, has been in constant eruption for 35 years. Lava flows from the volcano have covered 48 square miles, according to the US Geological Survey. Scientists say it is nearly impossible to predict how long an eruption will last.\n\nOn Thursday, Kilauea began spewing lava into residential areas after a series of earthquakes over the past week, the USGS reported.\n\nStarting around 11 am on Friday, the island experienced a flurry of earthquakes, culminating in the massive magnitude 6.9 tremor. Residents in Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions, home to about 1,700 people, were ordered to evacuate in the early hours of Friday after officials reported steam and lava erupting from fissures in the road, the Civil Defence agency said.\n\nNo injuries or deaths were reported, but Hawaii Governor David Ige activated the Hawaii National Guard to provide emergency help.\n\nKeone Kalawe, 58, a native Hawaiian who was volunteering at an evacuation centre in Pahoa, shrugged off the latest quake as \"just part of life over here.\"\n\nHis family was forced out of the village of Kapoho, about 6 miles from Pahoa, after an eruption in 1960, and he's witnessed other eruptions over the past three decades. So he has lived with lava, which is not dangerous, he says.\n\n\"I tell people,'You just have to sidestep.'\"\n\nA 492-foot-long fissure ripped open a road and spewed lava for about two hours in Leilani Estates at about 5.30 pm, the Hawaii Volcano Observatory said.\n\nDale Miller, 58, a resident of Leilani Estates, said police knocked on his door at 4 am and ordered an evacuation.\n\n\"There are lava tubes on our property,\" he said referring to the natural tunnels underground that drain lava during an eruption. \"The whole thing is Swiss cheese.\"\n\n\"It felt like there was something under the house -- like a big snake was moving under the house,\" said Lee Begaye, 61, Miller's partner and housemate. Lee added this was the first time in eight years of living by the volcano that they'd had to evacuate.\n\nOne resident, Ikaika Marzo, told Hawaii News Now he saw \"fountains\" of lava as high as 125 feet.\n\nLava, which can reach temperatures of about 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit (1,150 Celsius), spread less than about 33 feet from the fissure, the observatory said.\n\nAerial footage showed a \"curtain of fire\" snaking through a forest on the island, said resident Jeremiah Osuna.\n\n\"You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff,\" he told Honolulu television station KHON.\n\nHawaii's governor has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard.\n\nThe Kilauea volcano is one of five that make up Hawaii's Big Island, with a lake of molten lava at its peak and an eastern rift erupting near-continuously since 1983.\n\nHowever explosions along its two active rifts are rare.\n\nAsta Miklius, a geophysicist from the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said there is no way to know exactly how long the eruption will continue.\n\n\"One of the parameters is going to be whether the summit magma reservoir starts to drain in response to this event, and that has not happened yet,\" Mr Miklius said.\n\n\"There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won't be just an hours-long eruption probably... so we are watching that very, very closely.\"\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse on Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) down the slope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nThe USGS had raised the volcano alert in the area from a watch to a warning, reporting that \"new ground cracks\" were discovered in the late afternoon.\n\n\"White, hot vapor and blue fume emanated from an area of cracking in the eastern part of the subdivision,\" the agency wrote.\n\nIt emphasised that the early stages of fissure eruptions are \"dynamic,\" and \"additional vents and new lava outbreaks may occur.\"\n\n\"At this time it is not possible to say where new vents\" could happen, it said.\n\nThe affected area is part of the Big Island's East Rift Zone, in which the Hawaii Volcano Observatory had \"identified magma movement\" and warned residents that seismic activities and eruptions could take place without notice.\n\n\"All areas bordering East Rift Zone at high risk for eruption,\" Hawaii County's mayor Harry Kim said on Twitter.\n\nUS Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was mobilising resources, as well as monitoring for forest fires, power outages and water supply issues.\n\nHawaii Island, or the Big Island, is the largest of the eight main islands that comprise the Pacific US state, an archipelago that includes hundreds of smaller volcanic islands.\n\nWei, who moved to Hawaii from California - known for its high earthquake risk - said the eruption was almost a \"relief\".\n\n\"People live here - the Hawaiians and local people have lived here forever,\" she said. \"You know what's going on; we have warning systems. Everybody should be prepared.\"\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been non-explosive, but a 1924 eruption belched ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring more than 1,500 feet high.\n\nIn the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles (kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes.",

      "body": "PAHOA, Hawaii (AP) - The Kilauea volcano sent more lava into Hawaii communities Friday, a day after forcing more than 1,500 people to flee their rural homes, and authorities detected high levels of sulfur gas that could threaten elderly people and those with breathing problems.\n\nThe eruption that began with lava flying into the sky from a crack in a road persisted with reports of molten rock spurting from several volcanic vents. Neighborhoods downhill from the vents were at risk of being covered up. At least two homes were destroyed, officials said.\n\nA huge magnitude-6.9 earthquake has rattled an area near the south part of the volcano, but the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no threat of a tsunami and transportation officials said no damage to roads has been reported. It came after a magnitude-5.4 earthquake struck the same area Friday.\n\nThis photo provided by Hawaii Electric Light shows lava flowing over Mohala Street in the Leilani Estates area near Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii Friday, May 4, 2018. Nearly 1,500 people have fled from their homes after Hawaii's Kilauea volcano sent molten lava chewing through forests and bubbling up on paved streets in an eruption that one resident described as \"a curtain of fire.\" (Hawaii Electric Light via AP)\n\nJulie Woolsey lives on a street where a vent opened up and channeled lava to within 1,000 yards (914 meters) of her house. When it appeared, she freed her chickens, loaded her dogs into her truck and evacuated with her daughter and grandson.\n\n\"We knew we were building on an active volcano,\" she said, recalling how she purchased the lot on the Big Island for $35,000 more than a decade ago after living on Maui became too expensive. But she thought the danger from lava was a remote possibility.\n\n\"You can't really predict what Pele is going to do,\" she said, referring to the Hawaiian volcano goddess. \"It's hard to keep up. We're hoping our house doesn't burn down.\"\n\nThe community of Leilani Estates near the town of Pahoa appeared to be in the greatest danger. Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subdivision directly to the east. But scientists said new vents could form, and it was impossible to know where.\n\nCivil defense officials cautioned the public about high levels of sulfur dioxide near the volcano and urged vulnerable people to leave immediately. Exposure to the gas can cause irritation or burns, sore throats, runny noses, burning eyes and coughing.\n\nMaija Stenback began to get nervous when she noticed cracks in the streets near her home. On Thursday, she shot video of the lava as it bubbled and splattered across a street about six blocks from her house.\n\n\"You can feel it all the way into the core of your being,\" she said. \"It's just that roaring and unbelievable power of the lava bubbling up and spitting up into the air.\"\n\nStenback, her daughter and grandchildren packed as much as they could into their car. The two kids were each allowed to select three toys to take before the family left for a friend's home about a 30-minute drive away.\n\n\"I have lived through a lot of lava flows here, but never this close before,\" Stenback said.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries. At least 100 people were staying in shelters Friday, with many more evacuees believed to be with relatives and friends.\n\nThe Hawaii governor activated the National Guard to help with evacuations and provide security for properties that were abandoned when residents fled to safety.\n\nKilauea has erupted periodically for decades, and scientists said they have no way of predicting how long the eruption will continue.\n\nA key factor will be whether a magma reservoir at the summit starts to drain in response to the eruption, which has not happened yet, said Asta Miklius, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\n\"There is quite a bit of magma in the system. . It won't be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\" Miklius said.\n\nAfter a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.\n\nHenry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\n\n\"This is our retirement dream,\" Henry Calio said.\n\nKilauea's Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nThe magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.\n\nOver the decades, most of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.\n\nA 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.\n\n___\n\nJones reported from Honolulu.

AP\n\nCounty, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning. Officials at the US Geological Survey on Thursday raised the volcano's alert level to warning status, the highest possible, meaning a hazardous eruption is imminent, under way or suspected.\n\nNearby community centers have opened for shelter.\n\nRanson Yoneda, the recreation director for a Pahoa community center, was readying the gymnasium for evacuees after it was selected as a Red Cross evacuation center.\n\nHe said the people who arrived first were hungry for information.\n\n\"They just want to know what's going on because they were told it's a mandatory evacuation,\" he said by telephone.\n\nThe US Geological Survey said new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nScientists said areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava. Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.\n\nThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district. A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors. A magnitude 5.0 earthquake was recorded hours before the eruption began Thursday.\n\nKilauea Volcano's summit lava lake overflows onto Halemaumau Crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Hawaii's Big Island. AP\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 16 kilometres downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nUSGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-tonne (9-metric tonne) rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring more than 457 metres high.

David Ige has signed an emergency proclamation after Kilauea Volcano erupted Thursday and a lava flow emerged in a residential neighborhood.\n\nThe proclamation provides state money for response efforts.\n\nThere are about 770 structures in the subdivision where lava is flowing onto the streets on the Big Island.\n\nA statement released by the governor's office says the \"danger is of such magnitude that it warrants preemptive and protective action in order to provide for the safety, health and welfare of the residents.\"\n\nIge says he's in contact with Hawaii County officials and supporting emergency response efforts. Ige also activated the Hawaii National Guard to help with mandatory evacuations and security.\n\nVolcano officials in Hawaii say there is no way to predict how long this latest eruption on Kilauea Volcano will continue.\n\nThe Big Island volcano began erupting Thursday, sending lava flowing through a subdivision and prompting the evacuation of about 1,500 residents. It was not an explosive event, where lava shoots skyward in dramatic fashion.\n\nAsta Miklius is a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory. She tells The Associated Press that there quite a bit of magma in the volcano's system.\n\nShe says it won't be an eruption that only lasts hours. But she says how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved.\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nOne Hawaii resident described a line of lava snaking through forest land as a \"curtain of fire.\"\n\nJeremiah Osuna captured the footage of the lava stream with a drone after Kilauea Volcano erupted Thursday on Hawaii's Big Island. Residents of a subdivision have been ordered to evacuate after lava flows appeared in the Leilani Estates neighborhood\n\nOsuna says it wasn't just a visual experience. He tells Honolulu television station KOHN that the sound was overwhelming. The only thing comparable is if someone \"put a bunch of rocks into a dryer' and turned it on high.\n\nHe also says he could smell the sulfur, along with the burning trees and other vegetation.\n\nOne resident on the southern part of Hawaii's Big Island says lava fountains were shooting 150 feet (45 meters) in the air through a crack at Kilauea volcano.\n\nIkaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that lava spread out over an area about 200 yards (182 meters) wide behind one house in Leilani (LAY-lah-nee) Estates on Thursday.\n\nHe says it sounds like a jet engine.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nHawaii County is ordering evacuations for all homes in Leilani Estates.\n\nHawaii County is expanding its evacuation order in response to the eruption of Kilauea volcano.\n\nThe county is now calling for all residents in the Leilani (LAY-lah-nee) Estates subdivision to evacuate. Earlier, the order was limited to just part of neighborhood.\n\nThe subdivision on the Big Island has a population of about 1,500 people.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nThe USGS says areas downslope of the erupting vent are at risk of being covered by lava. Currently, the Leilani Estates area appears to be at greatest risk.\n\nBut scientists say new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.\n\nHawaii's Kilauea volcano is releasing red lava into a residential subdivision, prompting the county to order mandatory evacuations.\n\nHawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said Thursday red lava emerged on Mohala Street in the Leilani Estates subdivision. The county is ordering evacuations for homes from Luana Street to Pohohiki Road.\n\nThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rocked the Puna district of the Big Island.\n\nEarlier in the week, the crater floor of the Puu Oo (POO'-oo OH'-oh) vent collapsed. That caused magma to push more than 10 miles downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nCopyright © 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "body": "HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted Thursday, sending lava shooting into the air in a residential neighborhood and prompting mandatory evacuation orders for nearby homes.\n\nHawaii County said steam and lava poured out of a crack in Leilani Estates, which is near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island.\n\nFootage shown on local television showed lava spurting into the sky from a crack in a road. Aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.\n\nResident Jeremiah Osuna captured drone footage of the lava burning through the trees, a scene he described as a \"curtain of fire.\"\n\n\"It sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could. You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff,\" he told Honolulu television station KHON.\n\nLava fountains were shooting 150 feet (46 meters) in the air, and molten lava spread out over an area about 200 yards (183 meters) wide behind one house in Leilani Estates, Big Island resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser .\n\n\"It sounds like a jet engine. It's going hard,\" he said.\n\nCounty, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning. Officials at the U.S. Geological Survey on Thursday raised the volcano's alert level to warning status, the highest possible, meaning a hazardous eruption is imminent, underway or suspected.\n\nThe county has ordered evacuations for all of Leilani Estates, which according to the 2010 U.S. Census has a population of 1,500. The state also mobilized the Hawaii National Guard to assist with evacuations.\n\nNearby community centers have opened for shelter.\n\nRanson Yoneda, the recreation director for a Pahoa community center, was readying the gymnasium for evacuees after it was selected as a Red Cross evacuation center.\n\nHe said so far, about 15 people have arrived, some with animals, and they are hungry for information.\n\n\"They just want to know what's going on because they were told it's a mandatory evacuation,\" he said by telephone.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nScientists said areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava. Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.\n\nThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district. A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nUSGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles (kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes.",

      "body": "PAHOA, Hawaii (AP) - Sputtering lava, strong earthquakes and toxic gas jolted the southern part of the Big Island of Hawaii as magma shifted underneath a restless Kilauea volcano.\n\nThe trifecta of natural threats forced stressed out residents to evacuate and prompted the closure of parks and college campuses on Friday.\n\nMultiple new vents, from which lava is spurting out of the ground, formed in the same residential neighborhood where molten rock first emerged Thursday. At midday, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck - the biggest of hundreds of quakes this week and the largest to strike the state in 43 years. Residents were also warned to watch out for dangerous levels of sulfuric gas.\n\nIn this still frame taken from video, lava flows over a road in the Puna District as a result of the eruption from Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island Friday, May 4, 2018. The eruption sent molten lava through forests and bubbling up from paved streets and forced the evacuation of about 1,500 people who were still out of their homes Friday after Thursday's eruption. (Byron Matthews via AP)\n\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory spokeswoman Janet Babb said the earthquakes reflected the volcano adjusting to the shifting magma.\n\n\"The magma moving down the rift zones, it causes stress on the south flank of the volcano,\" Babb said. \"We're just getting a series of earthquakes.\"\n\nShe said scientists were studying whether the quakes would affect the eruption.\n\nThe lava lake at Kilauea's summit crater dropped significantly, suggesting the magma was moving eastward toward Puna, a mostly rural district of forests, papaya farms and lava fields left by past eruptions.\n\nOfficials ordered more than 1,700 people out of Big Island communities near the lava, warning of the dangers of spattering hot rock and high levels of sulfuric gas that could threaten the elderly and people with breathing problems. Two homes have burned.\n\nJulie Woolsey evacuated her home late Thursday as a volcanic vent, or an opening in the Earth's surface where lava emerges, sprouted up on her street in the Leilani Estates neighborhood.\n\nLava was about 1,000 yards from her home, which Woolsey built on a lot purchased for $35,000 11 years ago after living on Maui became too expensive.\n\n\"We knew we were building on an active volcano,\" she said, but added that she thought the danger from lava was a remote possibility.\n\nShe said she thought it was remote even days ago when she began packing and preparing to evacuate.\n\n\"You can't really predict what Pele is going to do,\" Woolsey said, referring to the Hawaiian volcano goddess. \"It's hard to keep up. We're hoping our house doesn't burn down.\"\n\nShe let her chickens loose, loaded her dogs into her truck and evacuated with her daughter and grandson. She's staying at a cabin with her daughter's in-laws.\n\nTwo new volcanic vents, from which lava is spurting, developed Friday, bringing the number formed to five.\n\nState Sen. Russell Ruderman said he's experienced many earthquakes, but the magnitude-5.4 temblor that hit first \"scared the heck out of me.\" Merchandise fell off the shelves in a natural food store he owns.\n\nWhen the larger quake followed, he said he felt strong shaking in Hilo, the island's largest city that is roughly 45 minutes from the rural Puna area.\n\n\"We're all rattled right now,\" he said. \"It's one thing after another. It's feeling kind of stressful out here.\"\n\nState officials didn't report damage to roadways. Hawaii County Acting Mayor Wil Okabe said the larger quake cracked a beam in a county gymnasium in Hilo, forcing workers to be sent home.\n\nHawaii Electric Light said the jolt knocked out power to about 14,400 customers, but electricity was restored about two hours later.\n\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea's summit.\n\nThe University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses to allow students and employees to \"attend to personal business and priorities.\"\n\nAuthorities already had closed a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, because of the threat of sulfuric gas.\n\nAt Leilani Estates, where lava was pushing through cracks in the earth, some residents still wanted to get home.\n\nBrad Stanfill said the lava was more than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from his house but he was not allowed in because of a mandatory evacuation order. He was frustrated because he wanted to feed his rabbits and dogs and check on his property.\n\nOne woman angrily told police guarding Leilani Estates that she was going in and they couldn't arrest her. She stormed past police unopposed.\n\nLeilani Estates has about 1,700 residents and 770 homes. A nearby neighborhood, Lanipuna Gardens, which has a few dozen people, also has been evacuated.\n\nKilauea has been continuously erupting since 1983 and is one of five volcanoes that make up the Big Island. Activity picked up earlier this week, indicating a possible new lava outbreak.\n\nThe crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.\n\nResidents have faced lava threats before.\n\nIn 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town's main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.\n\nFrom 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.\n\nKilauea hasn't been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours' warning before it reaches their property.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Sinco Kelleher, Audrey McAvoy and Sophia Yan in Honolulu, Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, and Alina Hartounian in Phoenix contributed to this report.\n\nIn this still frame taken from video, lava flows toward a home in the Puna District as a result of the eruption from Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island Friday, May 4, 2018.

Aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.\n\nResident Jeremiah Osuna captured drone footage of the lava burning through the trees, a scene he described as a \"curtain of fire.\"\n\n\"It sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could. You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff,\" he told Honolulu television station KHON.\n\nLava fountains were shooting 46 metres in the air, and molten lava spread out over an area about 183 metres wide behind one house in Leilani Estates, Big Island resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser .\n\nCounty, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning. Officials at the US Geological Survey on Thursday raised the volcano's alert level to warning status, the highest possible, meaning a hazardous eruption is imminent, underway or suspected.\n\nThe county has ordered evacuations for all of Leilani Estates, which according to the 2010 US census has a population of 1 500. The state also mobilised the Hawaii National Guard to assist with evacuations.\n\nNearby community centers have opened for shelter. Ranson Yoneda, the recreation director for a Pahoa community center, was readying the gymnasium for evacuees after it was selected as a Red Cross evacuation center.\n\nHe says so far, about 15 people have arrived, some with animals, and they are hungry for information. \"They just want to know what's going on because they were told it's a mandatory evacuation,\" he says by telephone.\n\nThe US Geological Survey says new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nScientists say areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava. Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists say new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.\n\nThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district. A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, 30 April, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 16 kilometres downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nUSGS geologist Janet Babb says the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night, 1 May.\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1 500 feet high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square kilometres of land and destroyed many homes.",

A magnitude 5.0 earthquake was recorded hours before the eruption began Thursday.\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nUSGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet high.

Magnitude-6.7 earthquakes hit in 1983 and 2006.\n\nFriday's temblor came amid a series of quakes as lava breaks out from new vents in the Earth from Kilauea volcano.\n\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory spokeswoman Janet Babb says scientists are processing data from the earthquakes to see if they're affecting the eruption.\n\nShe says magma is moving down the rift zones, which stresses the south flank of the volcano.\n\n1:50 p.m.\n\nThere are no immediate reports of major damage after a large earthquake struck Hawaii's Big Island near a volcanic eruption that has forced residents to evacuate from their homes.\n\nHawaii National Guard spokesman Maj. Jeff Hickman says the Hilo airport and the highways didn't sustain any damage from Friday's magnitude-6.9 quake.\n\nHawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder says the county has yet to conduct a damage assessment.\n\nState Sen. Russell Ruderman says he could feel strong shaking in Hilo. He says merchandise fell off the shelves in a natural food store he owns. He also felt shaking during an earlier magnitude-5.4 earthquake.\n\nHe says residents are stressed out about earthquakes while coping with a lava threat from Kilauea volcano that has burned two homes.\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says a second large earthquake of magnitude-6.9 has struck on Hawaii's Big Island near a volcanic eruption that has forced residents to evacuate their rural homes.\n\nThe earthquake hit about 12:33 p.m. Friday and was centred near the south flank of Kilauea volcano.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says the quake wasn't strong enough to cause a tsunami. No tsunami threat or advisory is in place.\n\nThe state transportation department says on Twitter that no damage has been reported to roads.\n\nBefore the quake, Hawaii County Civil Defence said a new vent opened near an intersection.

      "body": "HONOLULU (AP) - Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted Thursday, sending lava shooting into the air in a residential neighborhood and prompting mandatory evacuation orders for nearby homes.\n\nHawaii County said steam and lava poured out of a crack in Leilani Estates, which is near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island.\n\nFootage shown on local television showed lava spurting into the sky from a crack in a road. Aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.\n\nResident Jeremiah Osuna captured drone footage of the lava burning through the trees, a scene he described as a \"curtain of fire.\"\n\n\"It sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could. You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff,\" he told Honolulu television station KHON.\n\nLava fountains were shooting 150 feet (46 meters) in the air, and molten lava spread out over an area about 200 yards (183 meters) wide behind one house in Leilani Estates, Big Island resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser .\n\n\"It sounds like a jet engine. It's going hard,\" he said.\n\nCounty, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning. Officials at the U.S. Geological Survey on Thursday raised the volcano's alert level to warning status, the highest possible, meaning a hazardous eruption is imminent, underway or suspected.\n\nThe county has ordered evacuations for all of Leilani Estates, which according to the 2010 U.S. Census has a population of 1,500. The state also mobilized the Hawaii National Guard to assist with evacuations.\n\nNearby community centers have opened for shelter.\n\nRanson Yoneda, the recreation director for a Pahoa community center, was readying the gymnasium for evacuees after it was selected as a Red Cross evacuation center.\n\nHe said so far, about 15 people have arrived, some with animals, and they are hungry for information.\n\n\"They just want to know what's going on because they were told it's a mandatory evacuation,\" he said by telephone.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nScientists said areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava. Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.\n\nThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district. A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nUSGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles (kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu and Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.\n\nLava fountains were shooting 150 feet (46 meters) in the air, and molten lava spread out over an area about 200 yards (183 meters) wide behind one house in Leilani Estates, Big Island resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser .\n\n\"It sounds like a jet engine. It's going hard,\" he said.\n\nCounty, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning.\n\nThe county has ordered evacuations for all of Leilani Estates, which according to the 2010 U.S. Census has a population of 1,500.\n\nNearby community centers have opened for shelter.\n\nRanson Yoneda, the recreation director for the Pahoa District Park, was readying the gymnasium for evacuees after it was selected as a Red Cross evacuation center.\n\nHe said so far, about 15 people have arrived, some with animals, and they are hungry for information.\n\n\"They just want to know what's going on because they were told it's a mandatory evacuation,\" he said by telephone.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nScientists said areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava. Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.\n\nThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district. A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nUSGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles (kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes.",

Neighborhoods downhill from the vents were at risk of being covered up. At least two homes were destroyed, officials said.\n\nJulie Woolsey lives on a street where a vent opened up and channeled lava to within 1,000 yards (914 meters) of her house. When it appeared, she freed her chickens, loaded her dogs into her truck and evacuated with her daughter and grandson.\n\nThe Kilauea volcano sent more lava into Hawaii communities Friday, a day after forcing more than 1,500 people to flee from their mountainside homes\n\nCivil defense officials cautioned the public about high levels of sulfur dioxide near the volcano and urged vulnerable people to leave immediately\n\nExposure to the gas can cause irritation or burns, sore throats, runny noses, burning eyes and coughing\n\n'We knew we were building on an active volcano,' she said, recalling how she purchased the lot on the Big Island for $35,000 more than a decade ago after living on Maui became too expensive. But she thought the danger from lava was a remote possibility.\n\n'You can't really predict what Pele is going to do,' she said, referring to the Hawaiian volcano goddess. 'It's hard to keep up. We're hoping our house doesn't burn down.'\n\nThe community of Leilani Estates near the town of Pahoa appeared to be in the greatest danger. Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subdivision directly to the east. But scientists said new vents could form, and it was impossible to know where.\n\nNearly 1,500 people have fled from their homes after Hawaii's Kilauea volcano sent molten lava chewing through forests and bubbling up on paved streets in an eruption that one resident described as 'a curtain of fire'\n\n'You can feel it all the way into the core of your being,' said Maija Stenback. 'It's just that roaring and unbelievable power of the lava bubbling up and spitting up into the air'\n\nCivil defense officials cautioned the public about high levels of sulfur dioxide near the volcano and urged vulnerable people to leave immediately. Exposure to the gas can cause irritation or burns, sore throats, runny noses, burning eyes and coughing.\n\nMaija Stenback began to get nervous when she noticed cracks in the streets near her home. On Thursday, she shot video of the lava as it bubbled and splattered across a street about six blocks from her house.\n\n'You can feel it all the way into the core of your being,' she said.

The two kids were each allowed to select three toys to take before the family left for a friend's home about a 30-minute drive away.\n\n'I have lived through a lot of lava flows here, but never this close before,' Stenback said.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries.

      "body": "HONOLULU (AP) -- Nearly 1,500 residents were ordered to evacuate from their volcano-side homes after Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano erupted, sending molten lava to chew its way through forest land and bubble up on paved streets.\n\nVolcano officials couldn't predict how long Thursday's eruption may last, prompting Hawaii's governor to activate the National Guard to help with evacuations and provide security to about 770 structures left empty when residents sought shelter.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nHawaii County officials said steam and lava poured out of a crack in Leilani Estates, which is near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island.\n\nFootage shown on local television showed lava spurting into the sky from a crack in a road. Aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.\n\nResident Jeremiah Osuna captured drone footage of the lava burning through the trees, a scene he described as a \"curtain of fire.\"\n\n\"It sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could. You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff,\" he told Honolulu television station KHON.\n\nAsta Miklius, a geophysicist with the USGS Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that there is no way to know exactly how long the eruption will continue.\n\n\"One of the parameters is going to be whether the summit magma reservoir starts to drain in response to this event, and that has not happened yet,\" Miklius said. \"There is quite a bit of magma in the system. . It won't be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely.\"\n\nCounty, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning. Officials at the U.S. Geological Survey on Thursday raised the volcano's alert level to warning status, the highest possible, meaning a hazardous eruption is imminent, underway or suspected.\n\nNearby community centers have opened for shelter.\n\nRanson Yoneda, the recreation director for a Pahoa community center, was readying the gymnasium for evacuees after it was selected as a Red Cross evacuation center.\n\nHe said the people who arrived first were hungry for information.\n\n\"They just want to know what's going on because they were told it's a mandatory evacuation,\" he said by telephone.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nScientists said areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava. Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.\n\nThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district. A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors. A magnitude 5.0 earthquake was recorded hours before the eruption began Thursday.\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.\n\nUSGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu and Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report.",

      "body": "Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted today, sending lava shooting into the air in a residential neighborhood and prompting mandatory evacuation orders for nearby homes.\n\nHawaii County said steam and lava poured out of a crack in Leilani Estates, which is near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island.\n\nFootage shown on local television showed lava spurting into the sky from a crack in a road. Aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.\n\nLava fountains were shooting 46 meters in the air, and molten lava spread out over an area about 183 meters wide behind one house in Leilani Estates, Big Island resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.\n\n\"It sounds like a jet engine. It's going hard,\" he said.\n\nCounty, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning.\n\nThe county has ordered evacuations for all of Leilani Estates, which according to the 2010 US Census has a population of 1,500.\n\nNearby community centers have opened for shelter.\n\nRanson Yoneda, the recreation director for the Pahoa District Park, was readying the gymnasium for evacuees after it was selected as a Red Cross evacuation center.\n\nHe said so far, about 15 people have arrived, some with animals, and they are hungry for information.\n\n\"They just want to know what's going on because they were told it's a mandatory evacuation,\" he said by telephone.\n\nThe US Geological Survey said new ground cracks were reported this afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.Scientists said areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava.\n\nLeilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur and it's not possible to say where.\n\nThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district. A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.\n\nThe Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.\n\nThe collapse caused magma to push more than 16 kilometers downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.USGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.\n\nMost of Kilauea's activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.\n\nPuu Oo's 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of kilometers of land and destroyed many homes.",

Officials say there's no tsunami threat to the Big Island.\n\nAfter a week of earthquakes and warnings, the eruption that began Thursday threw lava into the sky from a crack in a road and sent another line of molten rock snaking through a forest. The activity continued Friday, with reports of lava spurting from volcanic vents on two streets.\n\nPeople reported to the Geological Survey's website that they felt light to moderate shaking from Friday's earthquake. It had a depth of 4.2 miles (6.9 kilometers).\n\n-- -- --\n\n11:45 a.m.\n\nSome residents living near spattering lava in Hawaii are frustrated that they're not being allowed to go home.\n\nHawaii County has issued a mandatory evacuation order for neighborhoods near the lava flow in the mostly rural Puna district of the Big Island. In addition to the danger from lava, civil defense officials are warning the public about high levels of sulfur dioxide.\n\nBrad Stanfill says the lava is more than three miles (5 kilometers) from his house but he's still not being allowed in. He wants go home to feed his pets and check on his property. He's concerned about reports of looting.\n\nOne woman angrily told police guarding Leilani Estates she was going into the area and they couldn't arrest her. She stormed past the police unopposed.\n\n-- -- --\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nJulie Woolsey is hoping the home she built on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano won't burn down.\n\nShe lives on a street in the rural Big Island subdivision where a volcanic vent opened up on Thursday. Lava was about 1,000 yards (914 meters) from her house.\n\nShe let her chickens loose, loaded her dogs into her truck and evacuated with her daughter and grandson.\n\nAt least 1,500 residents in her Leilani Estates subdivision were ordered to evacuate, along with residents of the nearby Lanipuna Gardens subdivision.\n\nState Sen. Russell Ruderman, a Democrat who represents the rural district where the subdivisions are located, estimates no more than 50 people live in Lanipuna.\n\nWoolsey is originally from Oregon and purchased her lot for $35,000 11 years ago after living on Maui became too expensive.\n\nShe says she knew she was building on an active volcano but thought a lava threat was a remote possibility.\n\n-- -- --\n\n11 a.m.\n\nHawaii officials say two homes in a rural Big Island subdivision have been burned by lava from an erupting volcano.\n\nHawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said Friday that authorities are still confirming the extent of the damage.\n\nScientists say at least three small fissure vents where lava can erupt have opened up in the subdivision after Kilauea volcano erupted.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says as of Friday morning there's lava spattering and creating short flows that haven't traveled more than 33 feet (10 meters) from the vents.\n\nThe USGS says additional fissure vents in the area are likely.\n\nOfficials have ordered that residents evacuate from two subdivisions.\n\nAfter a week of earthquakes and warnings, the eruption that began Thursday threw lava into the sky from a crack in a road and sent another line of molten rock snaking through a forest.\n\n-- -- -- --\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nA woman who fled her home after Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted says she first started getting nervous when she noticed cracks forming in her neighborhood streets.\n\nMaija (MEYE'-uh) Stenback's house sits just six blocks from a bubbling stream of lava.\n\nShe filmed it as the lava splattered across a street before she packed up her car and left with her daughter and grandchildren.\n\nAbout 1,500 people were evacuated after the volcano erupted Thursday.\n\nStenbeck also says she smelled sulfur dioxide gas from the eruption. Authorities have warned the gas could hurt the elderly and people with breathing problems.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries. At least 100 people were staying in shelters Friday. Stenback was staying with a friend.\n\n-- --\n\n8 a.m.\n\nTwo housing subdivisions near Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano are under mandatory evacuation orders as the Big Island volcano's eruption continues.\n\nCivil defense officials said Friday in a statement that about 1,500 residents of the Leilani Subdivision were ordered to evacuate from about 770 buildings. Residents from the nearby, smaller Lanipuna Gardens Subdivision with 130 lots were also ordered out.\n\nOfficials say the eruption is ongoing with lava burning through forest land and bubbling up on two streets in Leilana Estates.\n\nFire officials also say high levels of dangerous sulfur dioxide gas have been detected in the evacuation zone. They say it's important the elderly, young people and those with respiratory problems to leave immediately.\n\nTwo shelters have been opened for residents.\n\n-- -- --\n\n6:20 a.m.\n\nHawaii civil defense officials say extremely high levels of sulfur dioxide gas have been detected in areas near the eruption of Kilauea Volcano on the Big Island.\n\nThey are warning people from those areas that it's very important for elderly and young people and those with respiratory problems to leave immediately.\n\nExposure to sulfur dioxide gas can cause irritation or burns, sore throats, runny noses, burning eyes and coughing.\n\nNearly 1,500 residents were ordered to evacuate from their volcano-side homes after the volcano erupted and sent molten lava through forest land and bubbling up on paved streets.\n\n-- -- --\n\n5:10 a.m.\n\nHawaii civil defense officials say the Kilauea Volcano on the Big Island is still erupting.\n\nThe officials say in a statement Friday that volcanic vents are erupting on two streets and that residents of two communities are under evacuation orders.\n\nThe statement says local emergency officials and National Guard members are helping residents get out of their homes.\n\nTwo shelters are open and officials have said more than 100 people are staying at them.\n\nNearly 1,500 residents were ordered to evacuate from their volcano-side homes after the volcano erupted and sent molten lava through forest land and bubbling up on paved streets.\n\n-- -- --\n\n3:55 a.m.\n\nMore than 100 people are staying the night in shelters after Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island erupted.\n\nThe eruption sent molten lava through forests and bubbling up from paved streets and forced the evacuation of about 1,500 people who were still out of their homes Friday after Thursday's eruption.\n\nHenry Calio says he noticed cracks in the driveway of his retirement dream home in the community of Leilani Estates. His wife Stella then took a call from an official who told them to get out immediately.\n\nThe two feared that they might lose their home.\n\nAmerican Red Cross disaster services director Debbie Weeks says 100 people were staying in one shelter with about 20 more staying outside the shelter in their cars. Seven more people were staying at another shelter.\n\nWeeks says many other evacuees were believed to have headed to the homes of relatives and friends.\n\n-- -- --\n\n12 a.m.\n\nNearly 1,500 residents were ordered to evacuate from their volcano-side homes on Hawaii's Big Island after the Kilauea Volcano erupted, sending molten lava to chew its way through forest land and bubble up on paved streets.\n\nOfficials couldn't predict how long Thursday's eruption may last.

      "body": "WATCH: Hawaii's Big Island was struck by another large earthquake on Friday afternoon, a 6.9-magnitude quake according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The large quake came a day after the Kilauea volcano began to erupt.\n\nSputtering lava, strong earthquakes and toxic gas jolted the southern part of the Big Island of Hawaii as magma shifted underneath a restless Kilauea volcano.\n\nThe trifecta of natural threats forced stressed out residents to evacuate and prompted the closure of parks and college campuses on Friday.\n\nREAD MORE: Hawaii's Big Island struck by earthquake near erupting volcano\n\nMultiple new vents, from which lava is spurting out of the ground, formed in the same residential neighbourhood where molten rock first emerged Thursday. At midday, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck - the biggest of hundreds of quakes this week and the largest to strike the state in 43 years. Residents were also warned to watch out for dangerous levels of sulfuric gas.\n\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory spokeswoman Janet Babb said the earthquakes reflected the volcano adjusting to the shifting magma.\n\n\"The magma moving down the rift zones, it causes stress on the south flank of the volcano,\" Babb said. \"We're just getting a series of earthquakes.\"\n\nWATCH: Video captures lava spewing into air from ground in Hawaii community\n\nShe said scientists were studying whether the quakes would affect the eruption.\n\nThe lava lake at Kilauea's summit crater dropped significantly, suggesting the magma was moving eastward toward Puna, a mostly rural district of forests, papaya farms and lava fields left by past eruptions.\n\nOfficials ordered more than 1,700 people out of Big Island communities near the lava, warning of the dangers of spattering hot rock and high levels of sulfuric gas that could threaten the elderly and people with breathing problems. Two homes have burned.\n\nWATCH: Hawaiian volcano spews lava forcing evacuations\n\nJulie Woolsey evacuated her home late Thursday as a volcanic vent, or an opening in the Earth's surface where lava emerges, sprouted up on her street in the Leilani Estates neighbourhood.\n\nLava was about 1,000 yards from her home, which Woolsey built on a lot purchased for $35,000 11 years ago after living on Maui became too expensive.\n\n\"We knew we were building on an active volcano,\" she said, but added that she thought the danger from lava was a remote possibility.\n\nShe said she thought it was remote even days ago when she began packing and preparing to evacuate.\n\nREAD MORE: Hawaii volcano eruption: What Canadians need to know\n\n\"You can't really predict what Pele is going to do,\" Woolsey said, referring to the Hawaiian volcano goddess. \"It's hard to keep up. We're hoping our house doesn't burn down.\"\n\nShe let her chickens loose, loaded her dogs into her truck and evacuated with her daughter and grandson. She's staying at a cabin with her daughter's in-laws.\n\nLocal authorities held a community meeting with residents from lava affected areas Friday night at Pahoa High School.\n\nWATCH: Aerial video shows pink smoke and ash from Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano\n\nTwo new volcanic vents, from which lava is spurting, developed Friday, bringing the number formed to five.\n\nState Sen. Russell Ruderman said he's experienced many earthquakes, but the magnitude-5.4 temblor that hit first \"scared the heck out of me.\" Merchandise fell off the shelves in a natural food store he owns.\n\nWhen the larger quake followed, he said he felt strong shaking in Hilo, the island's largest city that is roughly 45 minutes from the rural Puna area.\n\nWATCH: Hawaii's governor issues an emergency proclamation after volcano eruption\n\n\"We're all rattled right now,\" he said. \"It's one thing after another. It's feeling kind of stressful out here.\"\n\nState officials didn't report damage to roadways. Hawaii County Acting Mayor Wil Okabe said the larger quake cracked a beam in a county gymnasium in Hilo, forcing workers to be sent home.\n\nHawaii Electric Light said the jolt knocked out power to about 14,400 customers, but electricity was restored about two hours later.\n\nWATCH: Hawaiian residents capture huge plumes of smoke, ash rise after volcano eruption\n\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea's summit.\n\nThe University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses to allow students and employees to \"attend to personal business and priorities.\"\n\nAuthorities already had closed a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, because of the threat of sulfuric gas.\n\nREAD MORE: Hawaii volcano erupts, forces 1,500 to flee homes as lava bubbles up\n\nAt Leilani Estates, where lava was pushing through cracks in the earth, some residents still wanted to get home.\n\nBrad Stanfill said the lava was more than 3 miles (5 kilometres) from his house but he was not allowed in because of a mandatory evacuation order. He was frustrated because he wanted to feed his rabbits and dogs and check on his property.\n\nOne woman angrily told police guarding Leilani Estates that she was going in and they couldn't arrest her. She stormed past police unopposed.\n\nWATCH: Volcanic eruption forces evacuations in Hawaii\n\nLeilani Estates has about 1,700 residents and 770 homes. A nearby neighbourhood, Lanipuna Gardens, which has a few dozen people, also has been evacuated.\n\nKilauea has been continuously erupting since 1983 and is one of five volcanoes that make up the Big Island. Activity picked up earlier this week, indicating a possible new lava outbreak.\n\nThe crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometres) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.\n\nWATCH: Stunning video shows lava rising from massive crack caused by Hawaii volcano eruption\n\nResidents have faced lava threats before.\n\nIn 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town's main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.\n\nFrom 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.\n\nKilauea hasn't been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours' warning before it reaches their property.\n\n- Associated Press writers Jennifer Sinco Kelleher, Audrey McAvoy and Sophia Yan in Honolulu, Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, and Alina Hartounian in Phoenix contributed to this report.",

      "body": "A day after the most active volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii erupted, two major earthquakes rattled the island and fountains of lava gushed out of the ground in a subdivision, forcing residents to flee amid threats of fires and \"extremely high levels of dangerous\" sulfur dioxide gas.\n\nThe island shook at regular intervals, but especially so around midday Friday: A 5.6 magnitude quake hit south of the volcano around 11:30 a.m. local time, followed about an hour later by a 6.9 magnitude temblor, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency reported that the threat of a tsunami was low following the earthquakes.\n\nKilauea first erupted Thursday, sending white, billowing clouds of steam and volcanic ash into the sky and prompting emergency officials to order mandatory evacuations.\n\nAuthorities warned residents to stay out of the area Friday as molten rock shot high into the air from cracks in the ground in Leilani Estates, a subdivision in the Puna district, on the eastern side of the island.\n\nThe civil defense agency said there was \"active volcanic fountaining\" in the neighborhood, meaning the lava was springing up from ground fractures; reports indicated it was shooting 80 to 100 feet into the sky. The Geological Survey said at least six fissure vents have opened in the subdivision so far - and that more outbreaks are likely to occur along the rift zone.\n\n\"No significant lava flows have yet formed,\" the Geological Survey said. But at least two homes in the Leilani Estates subdivision caught fire, Hawaii News Now reported. About 1,700 people live in Leilani Estates.\n\nAs Kilauea roared to life, the deafening sound of grinding rocks echoed in the air, and fiery red-orange lava could be seen spurting from the ground.\n\n\"It sounded like there were rocks in a dryer that were being tumbled around,\" said Jeremiah Osuna, who lives near Leilani Estates. \"You could hear the power of it pushing out of the ground.\"\n\nEmergency officials reported dangerously high levels of sulfur dioxide in the evacuation area and warned: \"Elderly, young and people with respiratory issues need to comply with the mandatory evacuation order and leave the area.\" Residents were ordered to evacuate to nearby community centers serving as shelters, and the state's Department of Education announced that several schools would be closed due to \"volcanic activity.\"\n\nA state of emergency was issued by the County of Hawaii's acting mayor, Wil Okabe, and Gov. David Ige (D) issued an emergency proclamation and activated Hawaii's National Guard to help with evacuations.\n\n\"Please be safe,\" Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) wrote on Twitter.\n\nLess than an hour after the eruption began Thursday, wailing warning sirens joined the cacophony, Maija Stenback, a resident of Leilani Estates, told The Washington Post.\n\nAs dramatic as the sights and sounds are, the eruption and lava flow pose little threat to people's lives, thanks to a monitoring and alert system in place for years.\n\n\"It's been handled very well,\" Stenback said. \"Civil Defense has been saying they can't predict it, but there's a good possibility, so they made everybody very aware that this could happen. You know, pack a bag and be ready to leave.\"\n\nKilauea is the youngest and most active volcano on Hawaii Island, according to USGS. The eruption from the volcano came hours after a 5.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the island Thursday morning.\n\nSince Monday, the area has been rattled by at least 600 smaller quakes generated by magma flow from Kilauea, Janet Babb, a geologist with the Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory, told The Post.\n\n\"Earthquakes were happening every 10 minutes, it seems like. That was kind of unsettling,\" Osuna told The Post, adding that it was \"nerve-racking\" not knowing exactly where the eruption would occur.\n\nThe event has been building for several days, Babb said, and the tremors were a sign that magma could break through the surface any time.\n\nThursday's strong earthquake, which occurred about 10:30 a.m. local time, caused \"rockfalls and possibly additional collapse into the Pu'u Oo crater on Kilauea\" and sent a large plume of ash into the air, the USGS reported.\n\nThe collapse began Monday as magma, which supported the crater, moved out and down the rift zone, triggering the quakes, Babb said.\n\n\"Eruption was possible, and that's now what has happened,\" she said. \"Magma has made its way to the surface, and eruption has commenced.\"\n\nWhen Stenback got a call from her son that the volcano had started erupting, it felt \"unreal,\" she said.\n\nIt wasn't until she and her daughter saw lava coming up through the ground that she believed it.\n\n\"Once you see it, then you know it's really happening,\" said Stenback. She added that she even hesitated to pack because she didn't think the eruption would occur.\n\nBut after seeing and filming the lava, Stenback said, she and her daughter rushed back home to prepare to evacuate.\n\n\"We were trying to figure out what's the most important thing to grab,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to collecting legal documents and medication, Stenback said, she quickly grabbed sentimental pieces from her jewelry box and stuffed the items into the pockets of her shorts because she didn't have time to properly pack her suitcase. She said her family will stay with friends in Hilo, about 25 miles away, until it is safe for them to return.\n\nMany residents took to social media to share photos and videos of the eruption.\n\nOn Twitter, one person wrote, \"OMG my island is on fire\" and included a video of lava gushing from the middle of a road.\n\nOthers also expressed worry, with a user tweeting, \"Friends on the mainland asked me if I am OK. I am, not my island.\"\n\nSince 1983, Kilauea has erupted frequently, many times forcing nearby communities to evacuate.\n\nGeologists said the current seismic activities around Puna most closely resemble the events that precipitated a 1955 eruption, according to Hawaii News Now. That eruption lasted about three months and left almost 4,000 acres of land covered in lava, the news site reported.\n\nMore recently in 2014, lava again threatened the Puna district, specifically the town of Pahoa and its surrounding area, The Post reported. During that event, lava flowed as quickly as 20 yards per hour, and up to 60 structures were at risk.\n\nIn comparison, Thursday's eruption seems more tame, as the USGS reported that lava spatter and gas bursts erupted for about two hours and the lava spread less than 33 feet from the fissure.\n\n\"At this time, the fissure is not erupting lava and no other fissures have erupted,\" according to a statement released from the service shortly after 10 p.m. local time.\n\nHowever, Babb said the inactivity doesn't mean the event is over, and there is no way to forecast how long the eruption could last. Early Friday morning, Civil Defense also said that the fire department had detected \"extremely high levels of dangerous Sulfur Dioxide gas in evac area.\"\n\nBesides, the USGS noted, \"the opening phases of fissure eruptions are dynamic and uncertain. Additional erupting fissures and new lava outbreaks may occur. It is not possible at this time to say when and where new vents may occur.\"\n\nHawaii County Mayor Harry Kim tweeted that the Civil Defense Agency \"is on high alert on a 24-hour basis for possibility of eruption in lower Puna.\" The areas bordering the eastern part of the rift zone, Kim said, are \"at high risk for eruption.\"\n\nFor now, residents don't know when it might be safe for them to return to home.\n\n\"This stuff could go on for a couple days, weeks or months,\" Stenback said. \"Just the thought of everything now being gone - it's just not real yet. Maybe the next time we go there the house might be under 30 feet of lava.\"",

You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff,\" he told Honolulu television station KHON.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries, but at least 100 people were in staying in shelters Friday, with many more evacuees believed to be with relatives and friends.\n\nThe Hawaii governor activated the National Guard to help with evacuations and provide security to about 770 structures left empty when residents sought shelter.\n\nScientists have no way of predicting how long the eruption will continue, said Asta Miklius, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nA key factor will be whether magma reservoir at the summit starts to drain in response to the eruption, which has not happened yet, Miklius said.\n\n\"There is quite a bit of magma in the system. . It won't be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely.\"\n\nCounty, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.\n\nThe geological survey on Thursday raised the volcano's alert level to warning status, the highest possible, meaning a hazardous eruption was imminent, underway or expected.\n\nHenry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately.\n\nGeologists said new ground cracks were reported Thursday afternoon. Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.\n\nAreas downslope of the erupting vents were at risk of being covered by lava. Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur, and it's impossible to say where.\n\nThe eruption came after days of earthquakes rattled the area's Puna district.

A magnitude 5.0 earthquake was recorded Thursday, hours before the eruption began.\n\nKilauea's Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.
